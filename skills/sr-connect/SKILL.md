# ScriptRunner Connect

This file answers theory. Before touching the CLI read `references/cli-workflow.md`. Before writing a script read `references/scripting.md`. Read `references/testing.md` only when the user asks for tests.

## Before the first CLI call

Settle which command to invoke, once per session, ahead of every other CLI step.

1. `command -v sr-connect`. A hit means the CLI is installed and on PATH: call it as `sr-connect <group> <verb>` everywhere, including in commands handed to the user. No hit: call it as `npx @sr-connect/cli <group> <verb>`, and pin the session's first call to `npx @sr-connect/cli@latest` so the cached copy is current.
2. `<cli> cli check-updates --agent --raw`. The document carries `updateAvailable`, `current` and `latest`, plus `command` when there is an update. Exit 1 is a registry it could not read and exit 4 is a registry publishing no release; neither blocks the work, so say so and carry on with the version in hand.
3. When `updateAvailable` is true, name both versions and ask whether the user upgrades it or you do. Never upgrade without that answer.

The `command` field is the upgrade line derived from how this copy was installed, and it is right for npm, pnpm, bun and npx. It is wrong for two installs the CLI reads as npm, so check for them before quoting it: resolve `sr-connect` to its real path, or run `yarn global bin` and `volta which sr-connect`.

| Install                                      | Upgrade with                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| npm global                                   | `npm install -g @sr-connect/cli@latest`                               |
| pnpm global                                  | `pnpm add -g @sr-connect/cli@latest`                                  |
| bun global                                   | `bun add -g @sr-connect/cli@latest`                                   |
| Yarn 1 global                                | `yarn global upgrade @sr-connect/cli`                                 |
| Volta                                        | `volta install @sr-connect/cli@latest`                                |
| npx, or Yarn 2+, which has no global install | nothing to upgrade; run the next call as `npx @sr-connect/cli@latest` |

When the user runs it, hand them the one line, without `--agent` or `--raw`, and wait. When you run it, run that same line and re-run `cli check-updates` to confirm the new version answered.

The snapshots in this file, the connector table, limits, plans and package list, are dated 2026-09-12 and carry their source URL. Re-fetch the source when an answer hinges on the number.

## Is this skill current

Once per session, before the first CLI call. Skip it when `~/.agents/.skill-lock.json` and `./.agents/.skill-lock.json` both lack an `sr-connect` entry, when there is no network, or when GitHub answers 403: say so in one line and carry on with this copy.

1. Read `skills["sr-connect"].skillFolderHash` from the lockfile that has the entry. The project lockfile wins over the home one. `npx skills add` writes this hash, and it is the git tree sha of `skills/sr-connect` in the published repo.
2. Fetch the published sha of that folder. The endpoint is unauthenticated and lists every skill in the repo:

    ```bash
    curl -s 'https://api.github.com/repos/adaptavist/scriptrunner-skills/contents/skills?ref=main'
    ```

    Take `sha` from the entry whose `name` is `sr-connect`.

3. Equal hashes: say nothing. Different hashes: tell the user this copy is behind the published skill and recommend updating, strongly, since the newer copy holds guidance this one lacks. Offer to run the update for them, or to hand them the line to run themselves, and say that either way the new files load from their next session, not this one, so the current session carries on with this copy. Wait for their answer. Do not run it without one.

    ```bash
    npx skills@latest update sr-connect
    ```

Do not compare `metadata.version` in this file instead. The folder hash changes on every publish and the version field does not.

## What it is

ScriptRunner Connect is a general-purpose, code-first integration platform as a service. You write TypeScript scripts that run in a managed runtime, wire them to events from external apps or to a schedule, and call other apps through typed clients. Coverage is deepest for Atlassian and the business tools around it, but the platform is not limited to them. Being code-first makes it a good fit for agents: everything an integration needs is a script, a configuration record, or a CLI verb.

Terminology: the official word for an external system is app. Use it.

## Can it integrate X

Two prerequisites. If both hold, the answer is almost always yes.

1. The app is reachable from the internet. SRC is SaaS. Its outbound calls leave from one static IP per instance, EU `34.251.34.27` and US `35.163.23.171`, which a firewall can allowlist to reach an on-premise network. A reverse proxy in a DMZ is the other route. For clients who cannot open a path at all there is private cloud hosting: the SRC team runs the product in an AWS account dedicated to the client, optionally inside the client's own VPC, reaching internal services directly, optionally cut off from the internet.
2. The app has an HTTP API.

A non-HTTP protocol needs an HTTP layer in front of it, which the client sets up. SQL databases are the usual example.

Inbound traffic to SRC, meaning webhooks, arrives through a cloud gateway with no static IP; a restricted network sending webhooks needs egress to the internet. OAuth consent needs a browser that can reach both the app and SRC.

## The building blocks

Five constructs. An event listener receives an event from an app and invokes a script. The script imports API connections to talk to apps. An API connection substitutes base URL and auth headers, using a connector, which is an authorized account. Everything lives in a workspace. Scripts can also run manually, from a schedule, or from another script.

## Capabilities

### Workspaces, HEAD, releases, environments

A workspace holds scripts, API connections, event listeners, scheduled triggers, packages, parameters and a README. It belongs to at most one team; visibility is private, meaning team admins and you, or public, meaning every team member. Language is js, ts or ts-strict. Always use ts-strict.

HEAD is the working version and is always editable. A release is a snapshot of HEAD, scripts, README and the release-level configuration of listeners, API connections and triggers, and it cannot change afterwards. Versions are semver and must increase. `release create -e <env>` cuts the release and deploys it into the environment in one call; `environment target-release` only moves an environment onto an existing release or back to HEAD. An environment targets HEAD or a single release and holds its own environment-specific configuration: the connector on each API connection, the connector and setup state on each event listener, a generic listener's URL path, each scheduled trigger's CRON and enabled state, each queue's enabled state, and parameter values. That configuration stays editable in a released environment; everything else is read-only there, and a resource created after the release is out of scope until a release containing it is deployed.

Every workspace starts with a single environment named Default on HEAD. Keep exactly one environment on HEAD and develop there; fix forward with a new release rather than editing an old one. Rolling back means pointing the environment at an older release or back at HEAD. Scripts read `context.environment.name`; `context.deployment` is undefined on HEAD.

### Parameters

Typed, per-environment values a script reads from `context.environment.vars`, one level of folders allowed. Eleven types, from TEXT and NUMBER to LIST, MAP and FOLDER; the type cannot be changed later. A default value seeds new environments and workspace copies, but the value itself is not copied and a default is not read at runtime. A required parameter blocks saving in the web app until it has a value; the CLI does not enforce it, so a required parameter can still be unset. For that reason `ev-params.ts` declares every parameter optional, required or not, and a script checks a value is present before using it; a required one is marked `Required: yes` in its JSDoc there.

A PASSWORD never reaches the script. The code sees a placeholder and so do the logs, and the real value is substituted only into an outbound HTTP call. So a password cannot be hashed, signed or base64-encoded in code; anything needing runtime handling goes in a TEXT parameter created with `--masked`. The full type table, the content types the substitution covers and the `ev-params.ts` consequences are in `references/scripting.md`.

**Never read parameter values without the user's explicit permission.** `environment-parameter list` returns them, and TEXT, MULTILINE_TEXT and MAP parameters can hold secrets that are not typed PASSWORD, masked TEXT among them. To see what exists, clone the workspace and read `ev-params.ts`: every parameter with its description, type and requiredness, and no values. `references/cli-workflow.md` has the rule under Posture.

### API connections and Managed APIs

An API connection is the outbound side: a path unique in the workspace, a vendor API package, and a connector per environment. Scripts import it, `import JiraCloud from './api/jira/cloud'`. Three tiers of abstraction, highest available wins: a Managed API, the typed client mirroring the vendor API one to one as in `JiraCloud.Issue.getIssue({ issueIdOrKey })`; managed `fetch` on the connection, where base URL and auth are supplied and you write the HTTP; and raw global `fetch`, where nothing is supplied. Managed APIs exist for every connector app; there is no public per-app reference, the typings in the workspace are the reference. monday.com's Managed API is GraphQL-shaped and takes `args` and `fields`.

Sources: https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/workspaces/api-connections, https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/managed-apis, and for the GraphQL shape https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/managed-apis/managed-api-for-monday-com

### Event listeners

An event listener binds an app event type to a script, optionally through a connector and an event queue. The event type, script and queue are workspace-level and captured by a release; the connector, URL path and enabled state are per environment. Creating a script from the listener gives it the right typed event. Setup is finished by a human registering a webhook in the app; the CLI returns `webhookUrl`, the callback to register, and `setupUrl`, the instructions. Most apps cannot register webhooks programmatically. A new environment needs the connector relinked and setup redone: the listener exists there and reports `disabled: false`, but its URL path is per environment and a fresh environment has none, so `event-listener get -e <env>` shows `urlPath` and `webhookUrl` as null and the listener is enabled yet unreachable. The first `event-listener update` in that environment assigns one, `--url-path` for a generic listener, a no-op update such as `--disabled false` for the rest, and the resulting `webhookUrl` differs from HEAD's, so the webhook is registered again. Most listener types need no connector at all; `event-listener get` reports `connectionRequired` for the ones that do. Still, when the team already has an authorized connector for the app, attach it: the setup instructions improve, because the app's base URL comes from the connector and the webhook deep link is built on it. When there is none, leave the listener without one; never make a connector just to give a listener one. Test event payloads run the listener with a stored sample; a new listener gets a seeded Default payload sampling its event type. The registration steps for each app, what the app can filter on its side and how its webhook is secured are one file per app under `references/event-listener-setup/`; load a file only when handing the registration to the user, as `references/cli-workflow.md` describes under Webhook handoff.

Sources: https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/workspaces/event-listeners

### Generic event listener

The Generic app's HTTP_ENDPOINT listener type. It accepts any HTTP request on a URL path that is unique across the whole platform and hands the request to a script: method, path, query, headers, source IP and a body parsed by content type into `json`, `text` or `base64`. Two modes. Async is the default: the caller is answered at once with an acknowledgement carrying the invocation ID, and the script runs afterwards under the usual 15-minute limit. Sync makes the caller wait for whatever the script returns, status, headers and body, within 25 seconds; past that the caller gets 408, and a response of the wrong shape gets 422.

Its primary purpose is to receive events from apps SRC does not support out of the box: anything that can send an HTTP request can trigger a script. It also covers apps that have no webhooks of their own when something else can be made to send the event. Confluence Cloud is the standing example: it offers no webhooks, so it has no listener type, but ScriptRunner for Confluence Cloud can listen to events inside Confluence and forward them to a generic listener's URL, which gives SRC a Confluence Cloud event feed after all. Two more apps reach SRC the same way. Trello has an API that registers a webhook, so point that webhook at a generic listener. Google Calendar and Google Sheets have no connector-level events, but Google Apps Script can watch the calendar or sheet and post to a generic listener's URL.

Because the sync mode sends a response back, the listener is also a way to publish something rather than only to receive. A script that answers with JSON is a small API of your own, in front of any system the workspace can reach, with SRC handling hosting, auth headers and logging. A script that answers with HTML is a custom user interface: a status page, a form, a lookup screen, served from the workspace with no separate web host. Between those two, the same listener adds security a plain webhook lacks: check a shared secret header, allowlist `sourceIp`, or validate a signature before doing anything, since the endpoint is otherwise anonymous.

Source: https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/workspaces/event-listeners/generic-http-events

### Scheduled triggers

Run a script on a six-field CRON, seconds first, in UTC. Minimum interval 15 minutes; tighter schedules are raised to it, and minute intervals should be multiples of 15. The CRON and enabled state are per environment; the script is shared. A trigger created after a release is inactive in a released environment until that environment is redeployed.

Source: https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/workspaces/scheduled-triggers

### Event queues

Default processing is concurrent. A queue makes a listener's events FIFO, split into independent streams by up to 10 dot-path groupings from the payload, `issue.key` for example. Eviction policy: a maximum queued time in minutes and an action, process out of order or drop with an email. Queued runs see `context.queue.{id,name,groupId}` and `context.queuedAt`. Paid non-legacy plans only; `team get` reports `features.eventQueues`.

Source: https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/workspaces/event-queues

### Packages

Three classes. Core packages, `@sr-connect/convert`, `record-storage` and `trigger`, and the event libraries `@sr-connect/<app>` arrive with the listeners you create. Managed API packages, `@managed-api/<service>[-v<N>]-sr-connect`, arrive with the API connections you declare. Third-party NPM packages are added by hand. All three classes are pinned at the version current when added and upgraded by hand; the one exception is `@sr-connect/runtime-types`, which tracks latest and cannot be changed. ESM imports only. Add `@types/<name>` beside a package without its own types. Packages built only for Node do not work; the runtime is a web-standards subset. The product's verified list is in `references/scripting.md`.

Source: https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/workspaces/package-manager

### Record storage

A key-value store scripts use for state across invocations: get, set, delete, exists, list keys. Scopes are environment, the default, workspace, team and invocation. Options: TTL, encryption, deny-overwrite. Rate-limited with automatic retry; no atomicity across concurrent writes. Capacity is per plan; see Limits.

Source: https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/scripting/record-storage

### Triggering scripts from scripts

`@sr-connect/trigger` fires another script of the same environment asynchronously with a JSON payload and returns an invocation ID. Used to fan out work and to build long-running jobs, a migration for one, as a chain of invocations each under the 15-minute limit with progress kept in record storage. Chains are capped; see Limits. A working example is the Tempo Cloud worklogs migration template, https://templates.scriptrunnerconnect.com/template/tempo-cloud-worklogs-migration?expand=true.

Source: https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/scripting/triggering-scripts

### Connectors and sharing

A connector holds an app's credentials, is created outside any workspace, belongs to a user and is looked up through a team. Sharing has three levels. Use lets someone attach it in workspaces, in all teams or named ones. Edit adds renaming and re-authorizing. Own adds sharing and deleting and stays with the creator. Connectors attached to a team workspace are implicitly usable by team members. Revoking Use, narrowing team scope, or leaving the team forcibly detaches the connector from workspaces. Most connectors authorize in a browser; the CLI creates one unauthorized and returns the URL. `connector get` reports the base URL a connector points at, the Atlassian site or self-managed host it was authorized against. That host is the best evidence of which installation a connector reaches, and it often settles whether an environment is production. Names settle nothing, since two connectors called Jira Cloud can point at a sandbox and a live site. The field is absent while a connector is unauthorized, and `connector list` does not carry it, so reading it costs one call per connector. It is absent too, authorized or not, for an app whose connector records no host: GitHub, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket Cloud, Microsoft Teams, NetSuite, Zoom and Statuspage, so an absent field says nothing about those. Jira and Confluence Cloud, the on-premise connectors, GitLab, Zendesk, ServiceNow, Salesforce, monday.com and Opsgenie record the customer's own host, and those are the ones where reading the base URL earns its keep. Slack records the app's configuration page on api.slack.com, which separates nothing from anything but is the page its event listener is registered on. Snapshot 2026-09-14, read from a Jira Cloud connector, a Slack connector and an unauthorized GitHub connector; the rest of the two lists follows from which connectors store a host at all.

How each app's connector is authorized, which methods its wizard offers and the fixed-key alternative through a Generic connector are one file per connector type under `references/connector-setup/`; load a file only when a connector has to be authorized or re-authorized, as `references/cli-workflow.md` describes under Connector setup.

The Generic connector reaches any HTTP API: base URL plus none, basic or custom headers. It does not do OAuth 2.0; for that, see the recipe in `references/scripting.md`. Its API connection exposes `fetch` only, and a Managed API can be built on it by passing `connectionId` to the `<Product>Api` class from the matching `@managed-api/*-sr-connect` package.

### Teams

Three roles. A Member sees workspaces shared with them, usage and the member list. An Admin also opens every team workspace, invites, edits roles below super admin, changes sharing settings and moves a workspace between teams they admin. A Super Admin also edits every role, the plan and billing, and can delete the team. One person edits a workspace at a time; others get a read-only copy and can take edit control. The CLI's workspace lock is that same control.

Source: https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/collaborate-with-teams

### Observability

Invocation logs are kept six months, per team. Each row has a status, one of Finished, Running, Denied, Timed out, Aborted, Function Error, Malformed Payload Error and Runtime Error; a trigger type, one of Manual, Manual Event Listener, External, Chained and Scheduled; and the console and HTTP log counts. Console logs cap at 1,000 lines per invocation; a line too large is stored separately. HTTP logs record every outbound call with headers and bodies truncated over 1 KB. Audit logs record every user action, six months. Replay re-runs an event-triggered invocation with an editable payload (not manual or scheduled runs, 4 MB cap). Script failure notifications email on uncaught errors, per user, per workspace and environment.

Source: https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/observability

### Security

AWS, in EU Ireland or US Oregon, chosen at signup; no data is stored outside the chosen region. Credentials encrypted with AWS KMS AES-256-GCM, TLS 1.2 in transit. Scripts run in fresh V8 isolates; enhanced isolation gives a tenant its own compute, at the price of more cold starts. ISO 27001, SOC 2 Type 2, GDPR, CREST-tested, Bugcrowd bounty. The in-app AI features use OpenAI models, with no training on your code.

Source: https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/security

### Templates

A template is a published workspace: connections, triggers and code for one use case. Most are examples. The Sync and Migration categories hold ready-made integrations worth starting from when the use case matches. Procedure: `template list` gives IDs and preview URLs; for a sync or migration ask also read the public library at https://templates.scriptrunnerconnect.com/ where `sitemap.xml` lists every template and `/template/<slug>?expand=true` renders the full README and source. Create from one with `workspace create --source-template-id`; the language is inherited, so upgrade it to ts-strict afterwards.

Source: https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/templates

### REST API and the CLI

Basic auth with the account email and an API key created under the user menu, API Keys; the key is shown once. Base URLs are `https://api.scriptrunnerconnect.com` for EU and `https://api.us.scriptrunnerconnect.com` for US. The CLI `@sr-connect/cli` is the client for it and covers workspaces, environments, parameters, scripts, listeners, payloads, queues, API connections, connectors, sharing, packages, releases, locks, logs, replay and abort.

### AI assistant

The web app has a built-in assistant. When working from outside, use your own capabilities and ignore it.

## Runtime in one paragraph

Not Node. A custom V8 runtime on a web-standards subset, ES2020 in syntax and standard library alike, ESM only: `fetch` with fully buffered bodies, `Request`/`Response`/`Headers`/`URL`/`FormData`/`Blob`, `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`, `btoa`/`atob`, timers, `console`, `crypto.getRandomValues` and `crypto.subtle` for keys, sign and verify only. No `Buffer`, no `process.env`, no `node:*`, no WebSocket, no streams, no `subtle.digest`, and no library method or option newer than ES2020 until a probe proves it, `Intl.DateTimeFormat`'s `timeStyle` being the known casualty. `@sr-connect/convert` replaces Buffer conversions; `jose-browser-runtime` signs JWTs. Full table and the coding rules in `references/scripting.md`.

## Connectors, snapshot 2026-09-15

Source: https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/connectors and the web application's authorization wizards. Every connector has a Managed API. The live catalogue with IDs is `app list`; query it rather than trusting this table when building. The NPM names of each app's events library and Managed API package are in `references/scripting.md`; they cannot be derived from the app name in this table. The Auth column is the wizard's own method; the per-app steps are under `references/connector-setup/`.

| Build or change an integration                | Gather requirements, probe connectors and environment, take the lock, clone                                                                                                 | `cli-workflow.md`, `scripting.md`                  | yes        |

When there is no bespoke connector, use the Generic connector for fixed-key auth. For OAuth, set the flow up in the workspace instead; the recipe is in `references/scripting.md`. When there is a bespoke connector but the user refuses every method its wizard offers, the app's file under `references/connector-setup/` names the fixed-key alternative through a Generic connector, where the vendor has one.

## Sending feedback

When the `agenticFeedback` switch is on, the work leaves notes for the ScriptRunner Connect team. What goes in them, when to post and the verb that sends them are under Feedback in `references/cli-workflow.md`. When the switch is off, the user has said no: no notes, no nudge to enable it, and no word about feedback in the summary.

## Asking questions

Front-load them. Before the first change, gather everything the work will turn on: which apps and which environments, what counts as production, whether you may probe and whether a probe may mutate, whether you may run a simulation loop with test payloads, which package upgrades are wanted, how the result will be tested end to end. One round of questions up front is cheaper for the user than a question every ten minutes, and it is what lets you go away, build in the simulation loop for as long as the user allowed, and come back once with something to test.

VERY IMPORTANT: a request for a plan does not skip that round. A plan for an integration written without knowing which environments exist, what counts as production, or whether you may probe is a guess dressed as a plan. Whatever mechanism your harness has for putting questions to the user, plan mode included, use it for these questions before writing the plan. The plan depends on what the workspace and the target apps hold, so probing belongs before the plan and not after it, but only once the user has consented to probing. No consent means no probe: write the plan from the reads the CLI allows and what the user told you, and mark each place a probe would have settled.

Front-loading is not a licence to assume. When the work raises a question the answers did not cover, or a probe shows something that contradicts what you were told, stop and ask. A wrong assumption in an integration costs a round of debugging against a live system; a question costs a minute. Probe when probing would answer it; ask when only the user can. Never skip either to keep momentum.

An obvious match is still a guess. When the ask names a resource loosely, "the Jira connector", a script by half its name, and the lookup turns up exactly one plausible candidate, do not write to it on that basis. Name what you matched, by ID as well as name, say what you are about to do to it, and wait for the user. Reads need none of this, so probe first and bring the candidate to the question rather than asking which one they meant.

The single match is the trap, not the safeguard. A sandbox connector and a live one share a name more often than not, a script name repeats across workspaces, and the one candidate in view can be the only one because the scope was wrong. Where the ask is exact, an ID, or a name with nothing else close to it, go ahead.
