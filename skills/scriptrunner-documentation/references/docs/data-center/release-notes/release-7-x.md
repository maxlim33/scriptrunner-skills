### Documentation update

## 7.11.0

22 Feb 2023

### HAPI is HERE!

Our major scripting innovation is here: a new and simplified way to define your Jira automations in Groovy (the scripting language most commonly found in ScriptRunner products). It's time to get HAPI!

HAPI is an API (application programming interface) optimized for Jira automations and tightly integrated with the script editor. With HAPI you will be able to create automations and customizations faster than ever.

Upskill easily on automation and customization with the helpful completions and work with simple, readable code. To find out more about HAPI, check out the [user documentation](../uncategorized/h/hapi.md).

### HAPI example scripts

We've updated a number of [Example Scripts](https://www.scriptrunnerhq.com/help/example-scripts?ScriptRunner%5BrefinementList%5D%5Bapp%5D%5B0%5D=script-runner-jira&ScriptRunner%5BrefinementList%5D%5Bplatform%5D%5B0%5D=dataCenter&ScriptRunner%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btag%5D%5B0%5D=hapi) to include HAPI methods. If you have used any of these scripts in the past, you'll notice they're shorter and easier to understand because of HAPI.

## 7.10.0

08 Feb 2023

### The clear Jira caches feature has been removed

We have removed this feature as it is unsafe to clear Jira caches in Data Center (SRJIRA-6417 - Remove "clear Jira caches").

If you wish to clear Jira caches in a Server instance, check out this [Example Script](https://www.scriptrunnerhq.com/help/example-scripts/clear-jira-caches-onPrem).

### Groovy 3 update

This is the update you have all been waiting for, we have updated ScriptRunner for Jira Server/Data Center to Groovy 3! What comes with this update and how will it benefit you?

To start, the language parser has been reimplemented in Groovy 3 under the [Parrot Parser](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html#Groovy3.0releasenotes-Parrot) codename. This new parser brings a number of syntax improvements which could benefit you as a user of ScriptRunner. The Groovy 3 syntax improvements include the following:

-   Improvements that bring Groovy syntax closer to that of modern Java, such as [interface default methods](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html#_interface_default_methods), [Java style lambda syntax](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html#_java_style_lambda_syntax), [Java style method references](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html#_method_references) or [try-with-resources statements](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html#_arm_try_with_resources).
-   Additional operators, for example [`!in` and `!instanceof`](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html#_in_and_instanceof_operators) , [`===` and `!==` for identity comparison](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html#_identity_comparison_operators) or [null safe subscript operator](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html#_identity_comparison_operators).

In addition, there are a handful of minor general improvements, for example [new GDK methods](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html#Groovy3.0releasenotes-GDKimprovements) or the [`@NullCheck` AST transformation](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html#_nullcheck_ast_transformation) .

For a full list of changes see the [release notes for Groovy 3](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html).

#### Breaking changes

There are a number of known breaking changes in Groovy 3. The breaking changes include [relocation of some classes to different packages](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html#Groovy3.0releasenotes-Splitpackages). All the other breaking changes for Groovy 3 are listed in [the release notes](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html#Groovy3.0releasenotes-OtherBreaking). There are also some additional minor breaking changes in [Groovy 3.0.5.](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html#_breaking_changes) and [Groovy 3.0.8](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html#_breaking_changes2).

We don't believe that any of these changes are significant, or that they should affect a large number of ScriptRunner users. However, there is a chance this update may cause some of your scripts to fail.

If you have any issues please contact our customer support team.

### `SrSpecification` has been deprecated

In the past, when [writing tests](../best-practices/write-and-run-tests.md), we provided an example to extend `com.onresolve.scriptrunner.canned.common.admin.SrSpecification`.

`SrSpecification` will be removed in a future release of ScriptRunner, but is still available in the current release. From now on please use `spock.lang.Specification` as the base for your tests.

### Jsoup update

We have updated our internal version of Jsoup to 1.15.3 due to a potential vulnerability. The key change is the replacement of `org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist` with `org.jsoup.safety.Safelist`. Please find more information at [https://jsoup.org/news/release-1.15.1](https://jsoup.org/news/release-1.15.1).
