### IntelliJ IDEA Plugin Deprecation

We are officially deprecating the IntelliJ IDEA plugin, also known as the _Adaptavist Power Editor_. ScriptRunner 5.6.13 contains the last bugfix we will ship for this feature, and 0.7.20 is the last release we will make on the JetBrains marketplace. Future support requests for this feature will be referred to this deprecation notice.

As can be seen from the review history on [our JetBrains marketplace listing](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9751-adaptavist-scriptrunner-power-editor), we haven't been consistently keeping up with JetBrains's quarterly release schedule, due to prioritization constraints.

### Reasons for the Change

Two key concerns motivated our decision to deprecate: the opportunity cost of developing the _Adaptavist Power Editor_ and its overlap with other ScriptRunner features.

The IntelliJ IDEA platform is a rich, fast-moving one. Just about every release requires refactoring some part of our plugin's codebase. As users of IntelliJ IDEA, we love this rapid development. However, it is a challenge to keep up with developing a secondary plugin that is not our core product, while also keeping an eye on the Atlassian release cycle. While IntelliJ IDEA was an interesting platform to expand into, it required more focus than we were able to give it.

Further, we are continuing to maintain and develop two other features which meet most of the needs met by the IntelliJ Plugin. These are the _[Code Editor](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/best-practices/write-code/code-editor)_ and [the `scriptrunner-samples` repository for local development](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/best-practices/write-code/create-a-script-plugin) .

The _Code Editor_ provides smart completions, parameter hints, and javadoc lookup. While that's nowhere near the feature set provided by IntelliJ IDEA, it does provide a rich development experience, one which we'd like to develop further. Most importantly, the _Code Editor_

The _Code Editor_ provides smart completions, parameter hints, and javadoc lookup. While that's nowhere near the feature set provided by IntelliJ IDEA, it does provide a rich development experience, one which we'd like to develop further. Most importantly, the _Code Editor_ is up and running by default with no setup.

For users who want a deeper development experience and don't mind some setup, developing a _Script Plugin_ affords a fully featured IDE, git integration, the ability to save script configuration as code, and other developer tools.

With the addition of the _Code Editor_ (with built-in autocompletion), and the new _Script Editor_ (allowing users to save files in script roots), the _Adaptavist Power Editor_ had a very niche user base with a very high maintenance burden. Although we had reservations about deprecating the IntelliJ IDEA integration due to feature loss in the short term, increased investment in the core ScriptRunner product is our priority.

Continuing to let the _Adaptavist Power Editor_ lag with late compatibility updates wasn't fair to our users, and we are committed to delivering more new features and improvements to the ScriptRunner product itself.

Ultimately, creating a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA was a valuable experiment. It taught us important lessons about providing a rich code editor that we still want to incorporate into the core _Code Editor_. We would love to hear from you which aspects you found most valuable. Please contact us through our support portal if there are features you would like to request for the _Code Editor_.

### Bug Fixes

-   SRPLAT-830 - IntelliJ Integration that was broken in 5.6.6 and beyond, is now fixed.
-   SRJIRA-4077 - Script Editor icons are now displayed correctly.
-   SRJIRA-4066 - Escalation Services are now successfully migrated to jobs.
-   SRJIRA-4057 - Creating a planning board item with action == "comment" does now show the item.

## 5.6.12

-   Released 22 Jan 2020.

### ScriptRunner Remote Events Code Execution Vulnerability

An HTTP POST made to `/rest/scriptrunner/latest/remote-events` with a specially crafted JSON payload could lead to unrestricted Groovy code execution for any logged-in user, regardless of permissions.

This security vulnerability has been fixed in ScriptRunner 5.6.12; it is recommended all customers upgrade to 5.6.12+ where possible.

If no firewall is enabled, users must update ScriptRunner to include this security patch.

### Temporary Workaround

If you are unable to upgrade immediately, blocking HTTP requests beginning with `<base_url>rest/scriptrunner/*/remote-events` mitigates the vulnerability.

Tip: To verify the workaround is applied correctly check that requests to <base\_url>rest/scriptrunner/\*/remote-events/ are denied.

Below are examples of how to apply the workaround in Apache and Tomcat by blocking requests to the Scriptrunner Remote Events endpoint at the reverse proxy, load-balancer or application server level.

Note: Please note that Adaptavist Support does not provide any assistance for configuring reverse proxies. Consequently, we provide the below examples as is, with no support and no written or implied warranties. To verify the workaround is applied correctly check that requests to <base\_url>rest/scriptrunner/\*/remote-events/ are denied.

### Apache HTTPD Reverse Proxy

#### Apache 2.4 Syntax

Add the following into the `.conf` file containing the virtualhost that proxies to the Atlassian application.

```
<LocationMatch "/rest/scriptrunner/.*/remote-events/">
Require all denied
</LocationMatch>
Example:
<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerName jira.example.com
ProxyRequests Off
ProxyVia Off
<Proxy *>
     Require all granted
</Proxy>
ProxyPass /jira  http://ipaddress:8080/jira
ProxyPassReverse /jira  http://ipaddress:8080/jira
    <LocationMatch "/rest/scriptrunner/.*/remote-events/">
        Require all denied
    </LocationMatch>
</VirtualHost>
```

#### Apache 2.2 Syntax

Add the following into the `.conf` file containing the virtualhost that proxies to the Atlassian application:

```
<LocationMatch "/rest/scriptrunner/.*/remote-events/">
Order Allow,Deny
Deny from  all
</LocationMatch>
Example
<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerName jira.example.com
    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyVia Off
    <Proxy *>
         Require all granted
    </Proxy>
    ProxyPass /jira  http://ipaddress:8080/jira
    ProxyPassReverse /jira  http://ipaddress:8080/jira
    <LocationMatch "/rest/scriptrunner/.*/remote-events/">
         Order Allow,Deny
         Deny from  all
    </LocationMatch>
</VirtualHost>
```

### Tomcat urlrewrite.xml

Redirect requests to `/rest/scriptrunner/.*/remote-events/.*` to a safe URL.

1.  Add the following to the `<urlrewrite>` section of `[jira-installation-directory]/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/urlrewrite.xml`:
    
    ```
    <rule>
    <from>/rest/scriptrunner/.*/remote-events/.*</from>
    <to type="temporary-redirect">/</to>
    </rule>
    ```
    
2.  Save the `urlrewrite.xml`.
3.  Restart the Atlassian application.

## 5.6.11

-   Released 09 Jan 2020.

### Bug Fixes

-   SRPLAT-873 - Settings could have been null, which caused NPE in various locations.
-   SRPLAT-864 - An invalid object name, _null.AO\_31728E\_SR\_USER\_PROP_, was added when the plugin was run against an instance running on MS SQL Server.

## 5.6.10

-   Released 26 Dec 2019.

### New Features

Issue Archiving (Data Center 8.1+)

There are two new features in ScriptRunner for Jira server allowing users to archive issues. You can now configure an Issue Archiving Job or Archive this Issue Post-function.

New Features in Script Editor

-   Folder Support - Use the context menu to create new folders in the script root directory. Script Editor also supports the creation of nested folders, separate them using `/` character. Folders (and files) can be moved around the file tree using drag-and-drop.
-   Deletion Support - You can now remove files and folders directly from the Script Editor UI. Just right-click on the file or folder you want to remove and select Delete from the context menu.
-   Renaming Support - You can now rename files and folders using context menu option Rename available on each node in Script Editor.

Services and Escalation Services Moved to Jobs

Services and Escalation Services are now part of ScriptRunner Jobs. Migrated services run as expected, however; when editing a service, you must specify an application user in the User field. For more information see our Jobs documentation.

### Bug Fixes

-   SRPLAT-864 - An invalid object name 'null.AO\_31728E\_SR\_USER\_PROP' when running on MS SQL Server has been fixed.
-   SRJIRA-4017 - _Script Registry_ now picks up simple scripted validators.
-   SRJIRA-3990 - An issue with the Send Custom Email function has been fixed.
-   SRJIRA-3988 - An error with Send a custom email listener filing to find event has been fixed.
-   SRJIRA-3985 - The StackOverflowError when using AddedAfterSprintStart or RemovedAfterSprintStart JQL functions in card color queries is fixed.
-   SRJIRA-3983 - Having a large number of comments on an issue no longer causes re-indexing delays.
-   SRPLAT-862 - There is now support for cross-app, in-app fixtures usable from tests running outside of the app.

## 5.6.9

-   Released 12 Dec 2019.

### More Groovy Classes are Backwards Incompatible

We are continuing the background work that we started in 5.6.7.

If you have any custom classes in your script roots or configured scripts which extend `com.onresolve.scriptrunner.canned.jira.workflow.listeners.CustomListener`, those may be broken by this release.

If you notice the Listeners page is failing to load, this problem may be affecting you. One potential workaround: you can add the `@groovy.transform.InheritConstructors` annotation to your custom class. As before, if you need additional help as a result of these changes, please contact us via [our support portal](https://the-adaptavist-group-support.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/21).

### Scalability Improvements to lastComment JQL Function

In version 5.6.6 we released a scalability improvement to the `lastComment` JQL function.

Unfortunately due to an internal process problem, we neglected to include in the release notes the following information.

The changes to the implementation of [lastComment JQL function](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/jql-functions) in this version mean that a reindex of Jira is required for that function to work correctly.

Note: A background reindex of Jira is not sufficient. You must select the option "Lock Jira and rebuild index". Obviously this should be done out of business hours.

### Bug Fixes

-   SRPLAT-670 - An exception was generated when adding or removing an event in the Events field on the _Custom Event Listener_ screen.
-   SRJIRA-3982 - The wrong value displayed for scripted fields based on the current user.

## 5.6.2

-   Released 12 Sep 2019.

### Bug Fixes

-   \[SRJIRA-2931\] - SD Behaviours were executing off of the wrong ID.
-   \[SRJIRA-3681\] - Script fields were appearing empty.
-   \[SRPLAT-658\] - Could not use code completion features with @WithPlugin for some plugins.
-   \[SRPLAT-680\] - Dependent plugin classes weren't loaded correctly.

## 5.6.1

-   Released 15 Aug 2019.

### Bug Fixes

-   \[SRJIRA-458\] - Import of helper class not possible
-   \[SRJIRA-3328\] - Script Field partially duplicated after adding a new configuration context
-   \[SRJIRA-3391\] - Assigning closures with no parameters to script field bindings doesn't type check

-   \[SRJIRA-3658\] - potential class loader lock contention issue when parsing behaviours configuration
-   \[SRJIRA-3646\] - "Custom Script" Scripted Fields fail to show Execution History in user interface

### Fix for SRPLAT-560 - Occasional NoClassDefFound with @WithPlugin compilation customizer

Dynamically adding and removing plugin classloaders was found to be impractical and unreliable due to lack of control over classloader caches.

The behaviour has changed so that when any `@WithPlugin` annotation is detected, the classloader from the selected plugin(s) is available to all scripts. This is true when using `@WithPlugin` or not in subsequent script executions. This change does not affect performance as the system classloaders are first in the classloader order.

Continue to add `@WithPlugin` to any scripts that use classes from other plugins. Without this, after a restart, successful script compiling will be dependent on the order of execution. Static type checking will show errors if you forget to use `@WithPlugin`.

## 5.5.0

-   Released 06 March 2019.

### Code Insight

This release includes our first version of _code insight_, a set of features designed to increase productivity, discovery, and enjoyment, when writing code in ScriptRunner.

This consists of code completions, parameter lookups, and javadoc links (javadoc links currently for Jira only).

Take a look at the [documentation](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/best-practices/write-code/code-editor) for more information.

### Bug Fixes

-   \[SRJIRA-3140\] - 'Send Custom Email' canned script getWorkflowButtons.call closure returns incorrect workflow id for the Workflow Button
-   \[SRJIRA-3292\] - Behaviour's description cleared upon saving
-   \[SRJIRA-587\] - Use of 'Script Runner' under Administration should be restricted to Jira System Administrators permission
-   \[SRJIRA-3225\] - 'Show parent issue...' scripted field isn't indexed at time of child issue creation

## 5.4.49

-   Released 13 Feb 2019.

### New Features

Edit Scripts Permission and Settings Page

Now you are able to configure which groups with _Jira Administrator_ permissions can create or edit _ScriptRunner_ scripts. See [documentation](../get-started/settings.md).

### Bug Fixes

-   \[SRJIRA-2976\] - No compile context for UpdateBlockedIssues in registry
-   \[SRJIRA-3089\] - ScriptRunner IntelliJ Plugin does not provide link to accept SSL certificate as shown in guide
-   \[SRJIRA-3294\] - Default descriptions with Behaviours do not work in version 5.4.48

## 5.4.48

-   Released 30 Jan 2019.

### History of Execution Times and Failures Rates

Previously, for each script, we have displayed information about the previous fifteen executions. This includes how long it took, the payload, and whether it failed or not.

This can be useful but doesn't give you a long-term trend analysis - for example, is this gradually slowing down, perhaps as it processes more data? Has a recent change to the script caused it to slow down (or speed up)?

With this release we show execution speed and failure rates going back up to two years. Initially there will be no data available, but over time this should become a valuable resource.

### Inclusion of Canned Comments Plugin

This release sees the inclusion of [Template Comments for Jira Service Desk](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/built-in-scripts/template-comments-service-management) in ScriptRunner for Jira. This will enable us to better keep it up to date. By default this is disabled, as since it was introduced Service Desk provides a different method of achieving a similar thing. On installing this upgrade, if you have the _Template Comments_ app installed, it will automatically be uninstalled…​ the functionality is the same so you should not notice any difference.

See [the documentation](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/built-in-scripts/template-comments-service-management) for more information.

Note: There is a known issue that the resources are not correctly enabled if you had previously installed the Template Comments plugin. This is the issue: SRJIRA-3263. To work around this go to Built-in Scripts → Service Desk template comments, then click Disable, then Enable.

### Bug Fixes

-   \[SRJIRA-2944\] - Copy Project script does not copy the field names of customer request types

## 5.4.45

-   Released 18 Dec 2018.

### Change to Behaviours' getValue() Output on Linked Issues Field

Prior Behaviour

There was some inconsistency in the object type which getValue() returned when called on the Linked Issues field (i.e. `getFieldById("issuelinks-issues")`).

-   If the field contains no issues: `""`
-   If the field contains one issue: `"ISSUE_KEY"`
-   If the field contains multiple issues: `[FIRST_ISSUE_KEY, SECOND_ISSUE_KEY, etc.]`

Notice the differences in the object types. Two are strings, one is an array.

New Behaviour

As of this release, getValue() will always return an array for the Linked Issues field. This new behaviour is documented in the Behaviours [API Quick Reference](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/behaviours/api-quick-reference).

We are aware that this change will break backwards compatibility for some users. Take a look at the new outputs below to see what adjustments you need to make to your scripts.

-   If the field contains no issues: `[]`
-   If the field contains one issue: `[ISSUE_KEY]`
-   If the field contains multiple issues: `[FIRST_ISSUE_KEY, SECOND_ISSUE_KEY, etc.]`

### Bug Fixes

## 5.4.39

-   Released 08 Nov 2018.

### New Features

Restrict Available Issue Types

You can now use _Behaviours_ to [restrict which issue types are available](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/behaviours/behaviours-examples/restricting-issue-types) to different categories of users. This could be based on group or role membership for instance, and could be used to prevent for example, users in the _Customers_ role creating Bug tickets, and restrict them only to Support Request issue type.

Add to Agile Board Context Menu

You can now [add items to the context menu](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/fragments/board-context-menu-item) when you right-click on issue or issues in the planning or sprint boards. As with other web items you have the option of calling a REST endpoint which can cause a flag or dialog to be displayed (or have no visible output), or linking to another page. You can also add commonly-used actions that are available through the _"dot"_ menu to the context menu, for example _Create sub-task_, _Clone issue_, and so on.

## 5.4.34

-   Released 24 Oct 2018.

### Script JQL Functions are now Singletons

If you only use the JQL functions included in ScriptRunner this won't affect you, but if you have written your own, please read on.

We have fixed a couple of race conditions in JQL functions that may have caused problems under extreme load. JQL function classes are now only instantiated once. This may cause a problem if you have written your function class to have state, e.g. shared fields that are written from the `validate` method and read from the `getQuery` method. In the unlikely event this is the case, please refactor your JQL function.

### Version Synchronizer Delete Behaviour Modified for Deleting and Swapping to Missing Versions

When a version is deleted, you can specify the actions to be taken for issues associated with the version to be deleted. One of the options is to associate these issues with another version. A new option has been added to control the propagation of these events with the Version Synchronizer:

Previously, on a Version Deleted event, if there was a version in the swap that was not present in the source project, the version in the destination project would be deleted, and there was no control over that functionality. That could potentially lead to an unintended loss of information, imagine the following scenario:

Project A has versions 1 and 2, and Project B has version 1, but it does not have version 2.

The Version Synchronizer event listener is active with source project A and destination project B.

If a delete version event is called in project A, and in that event, it is specified that version 1 is to be deleted and swapped with version 2, that would work in project A because both versions exist. However, when that event is propagated through the Version Sync Listener to project B, it would delete version 1, and it wouldn't swap to version 2, because version 2 does not exist.

That could lead to a loss of information in project B.

In order to prevent this loss of information, the default behaviour has been modified to copy the version to the target project if it is not contained in that project. In the previous scenario, the new Version Synchronizer would realize the version that the user wants to swap to is missing in the target project, and it would create it there. That way the swap can be completed successfully and there is no information lost.

### Bug Fixes

## 5.4.28

### New Features

Issue and Remote Issue Pickers

Previously you could convert text fields to issue pickers…​ the problem with this is that the "view issue" renderer had room for improvement, and that when using the API you were returned plain text strings. With this release we are introducing proper [local](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/script-fields/built-in-script-fields/issue-picker) and [remote](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/script-fields/built-in-script-fields/remote-issue-picker) issue pickers, with full Behaviours support.

Commented and lastComment Visibility Predicate

Commented and LastComment now support searching on JSD comment visibility. You will need to reindex Jira in order to use this. See the [documentation](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/jql-functions).

New option to prevent impersonation of Jira System Administrators

Admin users have not been able to switch to a system admin for a long while, now we have added an option to prevent Systems Administrators from impersonating other System Admins. This feature is optional, and you can find out how to enable it in the [Switch User Documentation Page](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/built-in-scripts/switch-user)

Workflow Transition Buttons

As part of the Send Mail built-in script, the email template field now includes getWorkflowButtons in its binding. This _closure_ is called using `getWorkflowButtons.call()` and adds a button to the email body for every valid transition given the issue's current state.

## 5.3.0

-   Released 31 Jan 2018.

### New Features

Conditions and additional issue actions script file

You can now put your conditions and additional issue actions in a script file.

Potentially breaking changes

When ScriptRunner is installed the old inline scripts will be converted to support the new schema. This only becomes a problem if you downgrade to a previous ScriptRunner release.

If you do downgrade you should run the following script in `Admin → Script Console`, before downgrading.

Warning: This will only put the current inline script code back. Therefore if you've updated the condition or additional issue actions code to use a script file after upgrading then this won't be preserved when downgrading. You'll have to manually reenter the code after downgrading. Therefore we recommend you keep the relevant script files under your script root so you can refer back to them.

Behaviours for Jira Service Desk

You can now apply _behaviours_ to the customer portal. Things like help text, requiredness etc, follow the normal Service Desk theme.

Potentially breaking changes

Behaviours have been fixed so that when getting the value for a priority, it correctly returns a `Priority` object.

For example, so now you can correctly do:

```
getFieldById("priority").value?.name == "Highest"
```

If previously you were comparing the string value, for instance:

```
getFieldById("priority").value == "1"
```

You can either replace with code like the above, or change `.value` to `.formValue`.

### Hide or disable tabs on Jira issue screens

You can now hide or disable entire tabs with Behaviours. You might wish to do this to prevent a category of field attributes being edited at certain stages of the workflow, or by certain groups or roles.

### Set Allowed Options for Radio and Checkbox Fields

You can now use `setFieldOptions` to restrict the available options for radio and checkbox custom fields, in exactly the same way as with [select and multiselect fields](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/behaviours/behaviours-examples/restricting-priority-and-resolution).

### Script Search Within Script File Input

You now have the ability to search for scripts contained within your configured script roots inside ScriptRunner. Wherever you used to be able to paste the path of a script, you can now search for the script directly in the file input. Simply start typing the name of your script and the search will present suggestions that you can select!

### Execute Script Action in Automation for Jira

We now provide an action allowing you to run your own script, in Automation for Jira. [More](../integrations/automation-for-jira.md).

Please restart your system after installing the update if you intend to use this integration, otherwise you may get an error when saving the rule. We are investigating why this may happen.

### Compatibility with Jira 7.7 and Jira Service Desk 3.10.0

Compatibility with latest Jira release.

### Potential XSS Issues Fixed

Insufficient escaping may have allowed a vulnerability via XSS. However we judge the severity of this vulnerability as "low" as it would require a specific sequence of actions by an administrator.

## 5.2.1

-   Released 02 Nov 2017.

### New Features

Script Listeners - New Jira Service Desk and Jira Software Events

[Script Listeners](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/best-practices/binding-variables#listeners--en) are powerful tools that let you react automatically to specific actions in Jira. We have updated Script Listeners to include Jira Service Desk, Jira Software, and other events.

We have added more than 40 new events to Script Listeners, including Sprint started/completed, Agile Boards created/updated, and even SLA-specific events like Thresholds Exceeded.

Copy Project for Jira Service Desk and Bulk Update SLAs

ScriptRunner for Jira now makes administering Jira Service Desk even easier with updates to our [Copy Project](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/built-in-scripts/copy-project) built-in script, as well a new [Bulk Copy SLAs](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/built-in-scripts/bulk-copy-slas) built-in script.

New User Guides for Jira Service Desk and SmartDraw

We are very happy to share best practices guides for how ScriptRunner for Jira can help your Service, Support, and Operations teams. We provided clear examples for you to automatically [_create a Root Cause Analysis document_](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/script-fields/script-fields-in-jira-service-management/getting-the-most-out-of-service-management) on a transition, [_clone and link a development issue from a Jira Service Desk ticket_](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/script-fields/script-fields-in-jira-service-management/getting-the-most-out-of-service-management), or even [_email all watchers of issues linked to a development ticket_](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/script-fields/script-fields-in-jira-service-management/getting-the-most-out-of-service-management), so your support teams can spend time supporting your customers, not manually updating tickets.

We have also shown you how to use the new SmartDraw Object Notation (SDON) to [_automatically generate a diagram of your backlog_](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/integrations/automation-for-jira/execute-a-scriptrunner-script#smart-values--en).

ScriptRunner now supports the long-awaited issue link events when creating and deleting issue links.

Please refer to the documentation for the [IssueLinkCreatedEvent](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/server/com/atlassian/jira/event/issue/link/IssueLinkCreatedEvent.html) and [IssueLinkDeletedEvent](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/server/com/atlassian/jira/event/issue/link/IssueLinkDeletedEvent.html).

## 5.1.6.2

Released 15 Sep 2017.

### Updates

This update fixes a serious security vulnerability in ScriptRunner for Jira discovered during an internal review. We strongly recommend all customers apply this update at their earliest opportunity. Further details will be released in the coming weeks as part of Adaptavist's responsible disclosure approach.

All versions of ScriptRunner for Jira from 4.0.0 are affected. Below are instructions on which version we recommend you upgrade to:

-   If you have Jira 7.2 or above, upgrade to 5.3.26
-   If you have Jira 7.0 or 7.1, upgrade to 5.1.6.2
-   If you have Jira 6.4, upgrade to 4.1.3.29
-   If you have Jira 6.3.10 to Jira 6.3.15 inclusive, upgrade to 4.1.3.28
-   If you have Jira 6.3.0 to 6.3.9 inclusive, upgrade to 4.1.3.27

## 5.1.0

Released 30 Aug 2017.

### New Features

### Canned Script Fields

Scripted Fields allow anyone to make custom fields in Jira that are customizable, automatically generated, and visible and searchable throughout Jira.

While you can write their own custom Scripted Field today, we are very happy to provide new built-in Scripted Fields that make it very easy to get started with your own Scripted Fields - Date of first transition : Easily see when an ticket began, use this in JQL searches to ensure that issues are moving at a good pace - Time of last status change : Keep track of how long issues are in your workflow, use this to surface long-running issues in JQL searches - Number of times in status : Make it easy to see how often an issue is bouncing around, set alerts to help teams swarm on these issues to get them over the line - Show parent issue in hierarchy : Make the relationship between issues and their parent Stories, Epics, and even Portfolio relationships like Theme and Initiatives!

### Remote Control and Remote Events

[_Remote Control_](../integrations/atlassian-products/remote-control.md) is an easy-to-use new feature that allows you to execute code on other Atlassian applications with ScriptRunner installed. This may be come into its own if you have multiple Jira instances to manage, or as an easy way to synchronize data between instances.

[_Remote Events_](../integrations/atlassian-products/remote-control.md) allows you to listen to events that happen on a linked application, and respond to it locally. This may be a simpler way to integrate applications than adding a REST endpoint to the remote, then writing a listener than invokes it.

### Bug Fixes

-   \[SRJIRA-2283\] - Scope of Behaviors is Poorly Documented
-   \[SRJIRA-2302\] - Custom web item to trigger dialog renders it only when clicking on the text of a web item
-   \[SRJIRA-2183\] - Canned Scripted Field - Work Remaining in Linked Issues
-   \[SRJIRA-2336\] - canned script field to display issue type in the hierarchy above
-   \[SRJIRA-2364\] - Ensure compatibility with 7.4.\* versions

## 5.0.17

Released 14 July 2017.

### Behaviours and Inline Edit

Instead of disabling inline edit on the view screen entirely, Behaviours will now launch the Edit Issue screen if you try to edit any field with an associated behaviour. The behaviour will be applied there as normal.

### Bug Fixes

-   \[SRJIRA-2155\] - Clearing the Groovy class loader generates an error in Jira 7.0+
-   \[SRJIRA-2173\] - Scripted Field still called even if issue type is not configured
-   \[SRJIRA-2308\] - Copy Comments checkbox in a post function not working properly
-   \[SRJIRA-2309\] - Getting ScriptRunner reindexing failed to reindex Portfolio parent issue

## 5.0.13

Released 23 June 2017.

### New JQL Functions for Portfolio Users

If you use [_Portfolio for Jira_](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.radiantminds.roadmaps-jira/server/overview) you can now take advantage of two new functions for traversing the Portfolio hierarchy, allowing you to search for open Initiatives of closed themes, find themes with outstanding epics, epics with no initiative, issues with no children, and so on. [Read more](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/jql-functions).

### Choose Fields to Copy in Clone Issue/Create Subtask

The [Clone Issue](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/workflows/post-functions/clones-an-issue-and-links) and [Create Subtask](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/workflows/post-functions/create-a-sub-task) workflow functions now allow you to much more easily choose which fields to copy using a simple multi-select. Previously it would copy everything and you would have to "null out" those fields you didn't wish to copy in the additional code section.

### Jira Switch User Built-in Script Writes to the Audit Log

When this script is used, it will generate a log entry in the audit log. [Read more](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/built-in-scripts/switch-user).

### Workflow Functions Validation of Position

Some workflow functions need to be in a specific order in the list of functions. For example, fast-track, if placed on the _Create_ transition, should be after the system workflow function "Creates the issue originally". If they are not in this position they will show an error when viewing the workflow.

In some cases they may work fine as they are, although you will see the error message. If this is the case, just move it as requested. The error message will disappear when it's in the correct position.
