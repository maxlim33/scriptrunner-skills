Check out what's new for ScriptRunner for Jira Server.

## 6.58.1

14 Sep 2022

### Jira 9.2 compatibility

ScriptRunner for Jira Server/Data Center is now compatible with [Jira 9.2](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftware/jira-software-9-2-x-release-notes-1163763245.html).

## 6.58.0

24 Aug 2022

### New bugs fixed

This release focuses on fixing bugs to improve your experience of ScriptRunner for Jira Server/Data Center. See the Jira issues in the release notes below for more detailed information.

### Bugs Fixed

-   SRPLAT-1992 - Script files cause "Invalid duplicate class definition" error
-   SRPLAT-1322 - 404 on newFeatureDiscovery when loading up ScriptRunner pages
-   SRJIRA-6086 - Fragments Custom Web Item link velocity variables no longer working
-   SRJIRA-6070 - setFormValue on cascade fields incorrectly trigger behaviours fields changed warning message
-   SRJIRA-6041 - Behaviour server-side script not working if 'Issue Lock for Jira' is installed since SR 6.30.0

## 6.57.0

10 Aug 2022

### Fixed Database Picker custom field

We fixed this issue, SRJIRA-5652, so the correct fields display. Previously when using the _Two Dimensional Filter Statistics_ gadget, incorrect fields displayed.

Please note, this fix has created a new index for statistics mappers to use. If you have custom picker fields (database, Idap, custom), and need to display their results in the dashboard (e.g. _Two Dimensional Filter Statistics_ gadget), you must perform a full or background re-index.

#### New Features

-   SRPLAT-1986 - Make code editors wider in locations outside script console
-   SRPLAT-1982 - Property shorthand completions for setters
-   SRJIRA-6077 - Allow Users to display private channels in the "Post a message to Slack" built-in script

#### Bugs Fixed

-   SRPLAT-1980 - No completions for uppercase variable names
-   SRPLAT-1935 - Web items used to create menu dropdowns no longer working
-   SRPLAT-1708 - Invalid event classes used in Listener configurations can cause the listener to fire for all events
-   SRJIRA-6058 - ScriptRunner menu items are showing for project administrators
-   SRJIRA-6023 - Basic view UI for issueFieldMatch and issueFieldExactMatch JQL functions doesn't allow non-administrator users to select a "Field Name" value
-   SRJIRA-5979 - Web item links add a ? to the end of the URL, which breaks some link destinations
-   SRJIRA-5652 - Database Picker custom field doesn't work as expected with Two Dimensional Filter Statistics Gadget

## 6.56.0

27 Jul 2022

### Improvements when working with Custom Fields in the Editor

You told us that working with opaque custom field IDs is difficult when selecting the right field by ID and then later when reading code to understand which field is meant by an ID.

We have made some improvements to make it clearer to tie custom field IDs back to a more meaningful custom field name.

As a rule, we recommend using names rather than IDs to make your code more readable. However, it relies on people not changing the name and, to some extent, avoiding duplicate names. Where you need to use IDs, we also have suggested [a way to externalize them](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/best-practices/write-code/store-all-environment-specific-variables).

#### Completions

When using APIs that take a custom field _String_ or _Long_ identifier, we will also show the name and the type:

This is helpful when writing your code but doesn't help others, or your future self, when reading this code later.

#### Inlay Hints

When you use a literal ID in your code, an inlay hint will show beside it, containing the _Field name_ or _ID_, whichever is appropriate.

And:

These labels are not actually part of the code and will not be present if you copy them from the editor.

We find these helpful but are considering supplying an option to turn them off, along with other editor features. [Let us know](https://the-adaptavist-group-support.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/21) what you think.

##### New feature

-   SRJIRA-4450 - Enable listener for IssuePropertySetEvent

##### Bug fixed

-   SRPLAT-1953 - Adjust 'Inline / File' tab z-index

## 6.55.1

20 Jul 2022

Bug fixed

-   SRPLAT-1963 - monaco editor loader.js is being loaded from CDN rather than the plugin

## 6.55.0

14 Jul 2022

### Configuration Management for Jira (CMJ) integration

We've been working closely with our peers at Appfire to make the days of manual migration and change management, when it comes to ScriptRunner, a thing of the past. You can now use Configuration Manager for Jira (CMJ) to migrate configuration for the following ScriptRunner features:

-   REST Endpoints
-   Jobs
-   Workflow Conditions, Validators and Post functions
-   Script Fields
-   Resources
-   Fragments
-   Listeners
-   Behaviours

### ScriptRunner for Jira is easier to access than ever

It's now even simpler to navigate to ScriptRunner with two new shortcuts. Admins can now also access ScriptRunner for Jira:

-   via the cog icon in the top right, by selecting ScriptRunner in the Jira Admin menu
-   via the new ScriptRunner tab in the administration navigation menu.

### Upgrade checker

In major releases of Atlassian products, some classes, methods and fields are removed. If you use these and you don't change your code, your scripts will fail. In nearly all cases, these are deprecated for at least one major release cycle beforehand, to give you a chance to change your code. In this release, for Jira (for 9.0.0) and Bitbucket (for 8.0.0), we will show you these classes, methods and fields that have been removed in a subsequent major version, as a warning:

Not all deprecations are relevant - sometimes things are deprecated but they are not removed. If this is the case they are marked as a warning but without the additional pending removal warning.

#### New features

-   SRPLAT-1929 Support completions within delegating closures in editor
-   SRJIRA-6045 Allowing the Hide UI Element feature to hide web sections

## 6.54.0

05 Jul 2022

### Performance Improvements

This release contains some significant improvements to the compilation and execution of scripts.

This builds on some of the work done in SRPLAT-1925 to prevent deadlocks and benchmark key parts of the ScriptRunner codebase.

This change should be invisible to 90% of users, except perhaps as an improvement in the speed and reliability of ScriptRunner, which could improve the performance of Jira overall.

A key component of this change was increasing the minimum recompilation time for scripts from Groovy's default 100 milliseconds to 1 second.

While this is not the complete solution for SRPLAT-1922, users affected by that issue may notice a marginal performance improvement due to reducing needless access to their servers' filesystem. That said, we are still exploring further improvements for the problems introduced by slow disks and so that ticket remains open.

#### Bugs fixed

-   SRPLAT-1928 - Completions fail in closures with no parameters
-   SRJIRA-5912 - Behaviour is not able to set field to required or not required when editing the Issue
-   SRJIRA-5835 - Behaviour on comment field not working for Service desk project

## 6.53.0

15 Jun 2022

### New _Script Registry_ filtering feature

A new filter is available in the _Script Registry_. This filter, turned off by default, may be toggled on to view all failing scripts. Use the Show only scripts that may require attention toggle option to engage this feature.

Two significant bugs have been removed for this release:

-   An unexpected error with creating requests in Service Desk projects has been rectified.
-   A bug preventing the _Multiple Insight Object/s_ field read-only using Behaviours from behaving as expected when populating its values using the `setFormValue()` in the _Initialiser_ is removed.

#### New feature

-   SRJIRA-5513 - New Feature (Script Registry): Filtering ONLY "failed" scripts

#### Bugs fixed

-   SRJIRA-5963 - SR compatibility issue with Git Integration plugin
-   SRJIRA-5947 - ShowDialog and ShowFlag web item actions do not work on the customer portal
-   SRJIRA-5888 - Behaviours read-only doesn't work correctly for Multiple Insight Object/s field when using setFormValue() to set the Multiple Insight Object/s field in Initialiser

## 6.52.0

06 Jun 2022

### New bug fixes and improvements

This release focuses on fixing bugs to improve the experience of using ScriptRunner for Jira Server/Data Center. These include two issues related to web action items. See the Jira issues in the release notes below for more detailed information.

### Remote Event Listeners Functionality Removed

Remote Event Listeners were deprecated with the 6.42.0 release. As of the 6.52.0 release, they have been completely removed from ScriptRunner for Jira. If you still require the functionality provided by the Remote Event listeners, a similar outcome can be achieved using a [REST Endpoint](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/rest-endpoints) on the target instance communicating [via app links](../integrations/atlassian-products/via-app-links.md) or [remote control](../integrations/atlassian-products/remote-control.md).

## 6.47.0

09 Mar 2022

### A New Editor

We've replaced our in-app editor component with [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), the same editor that powers [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Importantly, this gives us a platform for future improvements. However, there are immediate benefits to this release: you get inline documentation (press Control+Space when completions are open), hover over methods and classes to see documentation, see completions automatically as you type, find and replace, and more. Learn more about using features of the new editor on our [Code Editor](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/best-practices/write-code/code-editor) page.

Empowering Atlassian administrators to write code, however simple, is at the heart of what we do. We hope the new editor makes you more productive and you enjoy using it! Let us know what you think.

## 6.42.0

12 Jan 2022

### Remote Event Listeners are now Deprecated

As of ScriptRunner 6.42.0 we have deprecated Remote Event Listeners. This is due to low usage and high maintenance costs. If you still require the functionality provided by the Remote Event listeners, a similar outcome can be achieved using a [REST Endpoint](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/rest-endpoints) on the target instance communicating [via app links](../integrations/atlassian-products/via-app-links.md) or [remote control](../integrations/atlassian-products/remote-control.md).

### Change to behaviour of `jiraUserPropertyEquals()` JQL function

As part of the fix for SRJIRA-5595, the behaviour of the `jiraUserPropertyEquals()` JQL function has changed. Previously, only active users would match when `jiraUserPropertyEquals()` was used, now both active and inactive users are returned. See our [documentation](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/jql-functions/included-jql-functions/user-functions#jirauserpropertyequals--en) for more information, and steps on how to edit your query to return only active users.

### Bug fixed

-   SRJIRA-5691 - 'Self-referencing filter' error triggered incorrectly
-   SRJIRA-5676 - Removing Behaviour mapping that mapped to all issue types or request types will remove other mappings under the same project or service desk
-   SRJIRA-5595 - JQL function jiraUserPropertyEquals does not return results if user is inactive

## 6.41.0

21 Dec 2021

Enhancement to the _Change Dashboard, Filter, or Board Ownership_ Built-in Script

We have added the ability for Jira Software users to change the ownership of boards using this built-in script. Check out our [documentation](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/built-in-scripts/change-dashboard-filter-or-board-ownership) for more information.

Change to the _Fires an Event when Condition is True_ Post Function and Listener

The _Fires an Event when Condition is True_ built-in [post function](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/workflows/post-functions/fires-an-event-when-condition-is-true) and [listener](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/workflows/post-functions/fires-an-event-when-condition-is-true) now wraps the selected event in an [IssueEventBundle](https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/8.5.1/com/atlassian/jira/event/issue/IssueEventBundle.html) instead of directly firing an IssueEvent.

### Unicode Bidirectional Override Characters Vulnerability

Recently, Atlassian highlighted a security vulnerability where special characters (unicode bidirectional override characters) were not rendered or displayed in the affected applications ( [CVE-2021-42574](https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/multiple-products-security-advisory-unrendered-unicode-bidirectional-override-characters-cve-2021-42574-1086419475.html?_ga=2.55315369.322944566.1636375808-1942073108.1631538975&_gac=1.189917657.1634652234.CjwKCAjw2bmLBhBREiwAZ6ugo1cpOjQ1h9AEUL2W9gYWvJyaT-Vv4ducCVnxB0Q44hUZAev3pfAbLhoCAjIQAvD_BwE)). This vulnerability could affect ScriptRunner if a user were to copy malicious code from an untrusted source and execute it within ScriptRunner. To mitigate this risk, we have added highlighting for bidirectional characters everywhere in ScriptRunner you can enter code. For more information please take a look at our [blog post](https://www.adaptavist.com/blog/trojan-codes-in-atlassian-products-and-scriptrunner).

### Behaviours Enhancement

Using Behaviours has been simplified.

Now, when setting form values for fields such as select lists, radio buttons, checkboxes, components, and versions etc, you can use the display value rather than looking up the IDs of the options themselves. The same also applies when setting the available options:

Example:

```
getFieldByName("My checkboxes").setFormValue(['Yes', 'Maybe'])
getFieldByName("My single select").setFormValue('Oranges')
getFieldByName("My versions field").setFieldOptions(['Version One', 'Version Two'])
getFieldByName("My radio buttons").setFieldOptions(['Yes', 'No'])
```

We will validate that the provided value(s) is acceptable for whatever context you are setting it in.

### New ScriptRunner Action for Automation for Jira

Automation for Jira has released a new API for third-party integrations. This allows us to provide some requested enhancements, such as the ability to retrieve the _initiator_ of the action, and the ability to use _smart values_. We have also added the ability to use [dynamic forms](../best-practices/dynamic-forms.md).

Because the API was so different, we have decided to provide a new action and deprecate the original one. If you need the new action, copy your script from the old action to the new, and remove the old one.

Read more in our documentation on [Automation for Jira](../integrations/automation-for-jira.md).

### Workflows Tab

You can now view, edit, delete and disable/enable ScriptRunner workflow functions from the Workflows tab. We have also made it easier to create a new ScriptRunner workflow function, by adding this functionality to the Workflows tab. See our [workflow functions documentation](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/workflows) for more information.

### Potentially Breaking Change

Previously, you could enable sorting in JQL queries through the use of the `getSortValue` closure and `sortAttribute` property in _Database_ and _LDAP_ pickers respectively.

These are now redundant. If you had implemented these, and don't make any changes, the sort order may not be what it was before upgrading. Assuming you want the default value to be indexed and to be used for sorting, it's safe to remove them. Otherwise, see the new configuration options at [Database Picker](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/script-fields/built-in-script-fields/database-picker) or [LDAP Picker](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/script-fields/built-in-script-fields/ldap-picker).

### Groovy Upgrade

The version of Groovy used by ScriptRunner has been upgraded from 2.4.15 to 2.5.11. Improvements and new features (like additional AST transformations, or the new `tap()` method) shipped in Groovy 2.5 are now available to ScriptRunner users. See the [Groovy 2.5 Release Notes](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-2.5.html) for more information.

As with any dependency upgrade, breaking changes could potentially affect users' scripts. However, the breaking changes between Groovy 2.4 and 2.5 are relatively minor. The low-level nature of most of these breaking changes means they are unlikely to impact many ScriptRunner scripts if any.

Take a look at the list of breaking changes in the [Groovy 2.5 Release Notes](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-2.5.html#Groovy2.5releasenotes-Breakingchanges) for further details.

### IntelliJ Removal

This version removes all support for the IntelliJ IDEA plugin. See our previous [deprecation announcement](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/release-notes/release-5.x#m_release-5-x-5-6-13--en__IntelliJ-deprecation) for our rationale and plans for the future.

### Hidden Fields Removal

_Hidden Fields_ custom fields, which were deprecated in version 5.6.14, have now been removed. Even though all the hidden fields configuration and data will still exist in the database, it is recommended that users change the custom field type of all hidden fields before updating to this version. To change the custom field type, follow the [Atlassian guidelines](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/change-custom-field-types-in-jira-server-158357.html).

If changing custom field type via the database, use the following type keys:

```
com.onresolve.jira.groovy.groovyrunner:hideable-textfield
com.onresolve.jira.groovy.groovyrunner:hideable-textarea
```

and custom field searcher:

```
com.onresolve.jira.groovy.groovyrunner:hideable-textsearcher
```

### Use of Natural Searchers in Script Fields

Previously many users may have used the [Natural Searchers for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1210967/natural-searchers-for-jira?hosting=server&tab=overview) plugin. Use of these searchers on script fields allows the use of gadgets such as _Two Dimensional Filter Statistics_ and _Heatmap_, for these fields.

This release of ScriptRunner includes searchers similar to those provided by the _Natural Searchers for Jira_ plugin. On installation of this version, ScriptRunner converts any usage of searchers in script fields from the plugin versions, to ScriptRunner-native versions.

Note: If you are only using this plugin for script fields natural searchers, you can uninstall the Natural Searchers for Jira plugin. To check your usage of the _Natural Searchers for Jira_ plugin navigate to Admin → Natural SearchersI.

Please see the [warning message](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/script-fields) on usage.
