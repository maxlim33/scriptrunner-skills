Note: Feature Release Summary

You can explore all the feature releases we've introduced to ScriptRunner for Jira, starting from version 7.0.0 onwards, on the [Feature Release Summary](feature-release-summary.md) page. This page is designed to assist you in finding the ideal version to upgrade to, all while catching up on any enhancements you might have missed since your last update.

Tip: Try our migration tools!

The ScriptRunner Migration Suite is a suite of tools that helps you plan, analyse, convert and deploy scripts with confidence, significantly reducing the manual migration effort. It supports (not replaces) your expertise. The suite is made up of three tools:

-   [ScriptRunner Migration Analyse and Assess Tool](../../migration-suite/script-runner-migration-suite-web-app/script-runner-migration-analyse-and-assess-tool.md): Use this tool to review your ScriptRunner Data Center scripts and configurations for risks and cloud readiness.
-   [The ScriptRunner Migration Agent](../../migration-suite/script-runner-migration-suite-web-app/script-runner-migration-agent.md): Use our specialised AI chat agent to create, convert, and optimise scripts, or you can use it to answer a variety of different questions about ScriptRunner.
-   [ScriptRunner Dev and Deployment Tool](../../migration-suite/uncategorized/s/script-runner-dev-and-deployment-tool.md): Use this tool to organise and deploy ScriptRunner Cloud scripts. It is focused on making it easier and faster for consultants and developers to migrate, test, and deploy scripts from ScriptRunner DC to Cloud.

If you have any questions, need help, or would like to request access, the quickest way to get assistance is through our [dedicated support portal](https://the-adaptavist-group-support.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1069).

## 8.68.0

14 Sep 2026

### Insight event scripts bug fixed

We've fixed an issue where scripts importing Insight event classes (such as `InsightObjectEvent` or `InsightObjectUpdatedEvent`) failed to compile and run when those types were used explicitly. These scripts now save and execute correctly without needing workarounds like using `def` instead of the concrete class.

## 8.66.0

14 Aug 2026

### Copy Field Value post function bug fixed

We've fixed an issue where the Copy Field Value post function did not copy values from a parent issue onto a sub-task field (for example, copying Epic Name to Summary). The post function now correctly updates and re-indexes the target sub-task, and parent/sub-task copies work as expected.

### Fields API visibility bug fixed

We've fixed an issue where the `/rest/scriptrunner-jira/1.0/fields` REST endpoint returned the names and IDs of all custom fields in the instance to any authenticated user, including fields outside their normal access. The response is now scoped to only return field metadata that is visible to the calling user.

### Security update

We've made targeted security improvements in this release as part of our ongoing hardening work. For more details on how we handle security and vulnerability management, see our [Vulnerabilities and Security](../get-started/vulnerabilities-and-security.md) documentation.

## 8.65.0

04 Aug 2026

### Third-party dependencies updated to remove CVEs

We've updated third‑party dependencies within ScriptRunner to address known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). These changes are part of our ongoing hardening work and do not indicate that your instance was exposed to security issues. For more details on how we handle security and vulnerability management, see our [Vulnerabilities and Security](../get-started/vulnerabilities-and-security.md) documentation.

## 8.64.0

17 Jul 2026

### Behaviours loading bug fixed

We've fixed an issue where, on some instances, the Behaviours admin page failed to load with a 500 error due to XML parser and classloader conflicts. Behaviour configurations are now parsed correctly, and the Behaviours page loads as expected.

### Groovy custom field type-checking bug fixed

We've fixed an issue where `GroovyCustomField` could throw type-checking errors when the field value was a collection of non-issue objects (for example, users). The field now correctly handles collections by checking the element types before treating them as issues.

## 8.62.2 (Server only)

26 Jun 2026

### Security improvement

In this release, we've strengthened security around core ScriptRunner endpoints. We're always working to make ScriptRunner as safe as possible, and this update is part of that ongoing effort.

## 8.62.1

24 Jun 2026

### Security improvement

In this release, we've strengthened security around core ScriptRunner endpoints. We're always working to make ScriptRunner as safe as possible, and this update is part of that ongoing effort.

## 8.60.0

08 May 2026

### Script export improvement: saved JQL filters

Saved JQL filters that use ScriptRunner JQL functions are now included in the [Script export](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/script-registry#exporting-your-scripts--en). These filters are listed in the main Output.csv file, and each one is also exported as a .json file in the jqlFunctionFilters folder. Saved filters that do not use ScriptRunner JQL functions are excluded from the export.

### Script export bug fixed

We've fixed an issue where the [Script export](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/script-registry#exporting-your-scripts--en) omitted Groovy source files from ScriptRunner script plugins. Plugin-backed scripts are now correctly included in the export.

### Behaviours bug fixed

We've fixed an issue where Behaviours mapped to fields (for example, setting Description to read-only) would trigger only for the first issue opened from a board. When navigating between issues on a board, the Behaviour now runs reliably for each issue.

## 8.59.0

01 Apr 2026

### Script export bug fixed

We've fixed an issue with [script export](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/script-registry#exporting-your-scripts--en) where a single invalid workflow (for example, a transition pointing to a nonexistent step) caused workflow configuration export to fail for all workflows, resulting in an `IllegalStateException` / `CacheException`. Export now skips only the invalid workflow and succeeds for the rest.

### JQL custom function bug fixed

We've fixed an issue where custom JQL functions were not immediately available on all nodes after being scanned on a single node. Custom JQL functions scanned on one node are now propagated correctly, allowing end users to use them across the entire cluster without additional steps.

## 8.58.0

27 Feb 2026

### Behaviours bug fixed

We've resolved a bug related to Behaviours and Jira quick actions/keyboard shortcuts. Fields set to read-only via a server-side Behaviour are now correctly enforced, even when accessed through shortcuts and even if the field has no value. Previously, if a field had no value, it remained editable via shortcuts even when configured as read-only.

### Script Fields bugs fixed

We've resolved a bug where Script Fields that return a parent issue could cause a `JsonMarshallingException` when creating subtasks or accessing issues via the REST API. Previously, creating a subtask or requesting an issue JSON in these configurations could result in an error or a broken response, even though the subtask was created successfully.

## 8.57.0

28 Jan 2026

There are only core component changes in ScriptRunner for Jira 8.57.0, so we do not have any new features or bug fixes to report.

## 8.56.0

11 Dec 2025

### Instance audit enhancement

We've improved the performance of our [Instance Audit](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/built-in-scripts/instance-audit) feature, ensuring faster and more reliable operation on larger Jira instances.

### Behaviours bug fixed

We've resolved an issue where Behaviours did not execute correctly on the full-screen Create Issue page (`CreateIssue.jspa`), so field options such as Issue Type were not filtered when the project was selected.

## 8.55.0

26 Nov 2025

### Script export improvements

We've made the following improvements to our [Script export](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/script-registry#exporting-your-scripts--en) feature:

-   ScriptRunner metadata is now included. The export now contains the ScriptRunner version, ScriptRunner app key, and Jira (host application) version. This information is stored in a .json file in the Instance information folder.
-   Legacy and duplicate workflow functions are now exported. Previously, these workflow functions were not included and would be missing from the export. They now appear alongside all other workflow functions.

### Behaviours bug fixed

We've resolved an issue with the Behaviours feature where our [Dynamic form](../best-practices/dynamic-forms.md) multi-select option did not work as expected.

## 8.54.0

14 Nov 2025

### New feature: Script export is now available for ScriptRunner 8.x

Previously, this built-in script was only compatible with ScriptRunner 9.19+ and 10.0+.

We've introduced an export feature in ScriptRunner. This feature allows you to export all scripts and configurations from your instance via the Script Registry, with the exception of ScriptRunner JQL function information.

In this context, "scripts" encompass a broader range of elements than typical custom script files. Specifically, we include:

-   All scripts within your [script roots](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/best-practices/write-code/script-roots).
-   All configured custom and built-in Jobs, Listeners, Fields, Behaviours, UI Fragments, REST Endpoints, Resources, and Workflow functions.
-   Custom fields.

See the [Script Registry](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/script-registry#exporting-your-scripts--en) page for more information on this feature.

Thinking of migrating to Cloud?

This feature will help you analyze your instance and scripts in preparation for [migration to Cloud](../script-runner-migration/script-runner-migration-to-cloud.md).

### New feature: Instance Audit built-in script is now available for ScriptRunner 8.x

Previously, this built-in script was only compatible with ScriptRunner 9.25+ and 10.1+.

We've created a new built-in script that enables you to quickly assess the current state of your Jira environment for easy cleanup, instance optimization, and migration preparation. You can also use the Export report button to download CSV files containing more information on users, projects, custom fields, and workflow functions. See the [Instance Audit](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/built-in-scripts/instance-audit) documentation for more details.

### Behaviours bug fixed

We've resolved a conflict between `setFieldOptions` and `setFormValue` for cascading fields in the JSM Portal.

### Security Improvement

In this release, we've focused on improving the security of ScriptRunner for Jira by addressing a known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE). We want to emphasize that this update doesn't mean your instance was vulnerable to security issues. We're always working to make ScriptRunner as safe as possible, and this update is part of that ongoing effort. Check out our page on [Vulnerabilities and Security](../get-started/vulnerabilities-and-security.md) for more details on how we scan for vulnerabilities and common security concerns.

## 8.52.0

20 Aug 2025

### Switch User feature update

In response to new Atlassian security requirements, we've removed the Switch User function from the User Management page and the user _More_ dropdown. The [Switch User](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/built-in-scripts/switch-user) function is now exclusively available as a built-in script.

### Behaviours bug fixed

We've resolved a bug related to our Behaviours feature where `setFieldOptions` only worked for the last system field when multiple server-side scripts were created for system fields (such as Priority, Affects Version/s, Issue Type, etc.).

### Security improvements

We've made a couple of security improvements in this release:

-   We have implemented a security improvement to our switch user feature. This update strengthens our protection against potential unauthorized account access.
-   We've addressed a known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE).

We want to emphasize that this update doesn't mean your instance was vulnerable to security issues. We're always working to make ScriptRunner as safe as possible, and this update is part of that ongoing effort. Check out our page on [Vulnerabilities and Security](../get-started/vulnerabilities-and-security.md) for more details on how we scan for vulnerabilities and common security concerns.

## 8.51.0

23 Jul 2025

### New documentation: Migration checklist

We've created a [Migration Checklist](../script-runner-migration/script-runner-migration-to-cloud/migration-checklist.md) to help you get started with migration from ScriptRunner for Jira DC to ScriptRunner for Jira Cloud.

### Bugs fixed

We've resolved multiple bugs in this release:

-   Behaviours bug: Restrictions on the Priority field in the JSM portal now function as intended.
-   _Clones an Issue and Links_ post function bug: The author/uploader name is now included on Attachments in cloned issues.

## 8.48.0

11 Jun 2025

### Bug fixed: Reindexing error following Portfolio upgrade

We've resolved a bug affecting users with issues created before a Portfolio upgrade. The issue caused errors during reindexing but has now been fixed.

-   Behaviours bug: We've resolved a bug related to our Behaviours feature where `setFieldOptions()` did not work correctly for Component fields on the JSM portal.
-   Common-runtime module bug: We resolved an issue where ScriptRunner's `common-runtime` module interfered with fields from other plugins.

## 8.46.0

15 May 2025

### Behaviours bug fixed

We've resolved a bug related to our Behaviours feature. Previously, when used together, `setFieldOptions` clashed with `setFormValue` for multi-select fields. This issue is now resolved.

### httpmime version update

`httpmime` version has been updated to version 4.5.14 to match the `httpclient` version. Previously, ScriptRunner for Jira had `httpclient` version 4.5.14 and `httpmime` version 4.3.1.

### Vulnerability scanner updates

When starting or restarting a Jira instance, the following error appeared in some server logs:

```
[com.onresolve.scriptrunner.runner.util.AOPropertyPersister] Exception thrown during AO initialization:
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to register initialization of Active Objects
```

This issue has now been fixed and the above error should no longer display.

### Listeners bugs fixed

We've resolved a number of bugs related to our Listeners feature. ScriptRunner encountered errors when interacting with custom listeners triggered by events from third-party plugins. Specifically, these issues occurred during the creation, modification, or execution of such listeners. Examples of events that caused errors include the following:

-   `ApprovalRequestedEvent`
-   `InsightObjectAsyncEvent` and its subclasses
-   `TestExecutionChangedEvent`

The bugs that caused the errors are now fixed and custom listeners should now work as expected.

### Groovy 4 update

We have updated ScriptRunner for Jira Server/Data Center to Groovy 4!

Our primary motivator for this update is to provide support for JDK 17. Groovy 3 doesn't support JDK 17, and with Jira 9.5.0 and Confluence 8.0 being JDK 17 compatible, an upgrade to Groovy 4 is necessary.

So, apart from JDK 17 compatibility, what comes with this update and how will it benefit you?

#### New features in Groovy 4

The following are the most significant new features that have been added in Groovy 4 :

-   [Switch expressions](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-4.0.html#Groovy4.0-switch-expressions) which, unlike switch statements, are optimised towards branches that handle one case and break out rather than fall through to the next case.
-   [Sealed types](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-4.0.html#Groovy4.0-sealed-types)
-   [Records](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-4.0.html#Groovy4.0-new-records)
-   [Ranges have been enhanced](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-4.0.html#_enhanced_ranges) with support for ranges open on the left, for example, `3<..5`, or both sides, for example, `0<..<3`
-   [Support for annotating generic types](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-4.0.html#_jsr308_improvements_incubating), for example `List<@IntRange(min = 0, max = 10) Integer>`

Please have a look at the [Groovy 4 Release Notes](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-4.0.html) for a complete list of new features.

#### Breaking changes in Groovy 4

Groovy 4 contains a number of breaking changes. The ones which are the most significant, and likely to affect ScriptRunner users, are listed below. Please have a look at the [Groovy 4 Release Notes](https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-4.0.html) for a complete list of breaking changes.

1) Changes to the resolution of properties with both a getter and isser returning different types

Note: An isser is a method to retrieve boolean properties. Instead of the method name starting with `get` (as is common for accessor methods), it starts with `is`. See [the JavaBean Properties tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/javabeans/writing/properties.html) for more information.

For properties that have a getter and an isser returning different types (for example, [JiraAuthenticationContext#getLoggedInUser](https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/latest/com/atlassian/jira/security/JiraAuthenticationContext.html#getLoggedInUser--) and [JiraAuthenticationContext#isLoggedInUser](https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/latest/com/atlassian/jira/security/JiraAuthenticationContext.html#isLoggedInUser--)) when accessing the property, instead of calling one of the methods (for example, `jiraAuthenticationContext.loggedInUser`), the getter is called in Groovy 3 but the isser is called in Groovy 4 - see [GROOVY-10821](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/GROOVY/issues/GROOVY-10821). You don't need to worry about updating scripts with the `loggedInUser` property on `JiraAuthenticationContext` as we have included a patch (see more below).

ScriptRunner for Jira patch

For backward compatibility reasons, ScriptRunner ships with a patch to keep the old Groovy 3 behaviour for two conflicting Jira API properties commonly used in customer scripts:

-   The `loggedInUser` property on `JiraAuthenticationContext`
-   The `created` property on `Issue`

We've included this patch as these properties will likely be heavily used in users' scripts. This means you do not need to change any code using these properties.

Solution for other properties

From Groovy 4 if you have custom classes, or are using external classes that implement conflicting isser and getter methods, and you are using the property syntax to get the getter value, you must re-write the logic to use the getter method directly.

For example, this class demonstrates conflicting isser and getter methods:

```
class GetterIsser {
  String getSomething() { 'yes' }
  boolean isSomething() { false }
}
 
def myClass = new GetterIsser()
 
myClass.something // used to return 'yes', as of Groovy 4 will return false
```

From Groovy 4, this should be written as:

```
class GetterIsser {
  String getSomething() { 'yes' }
  boolean isSomething() { false }
}
 
def myClass = new GetterIsser()
 
myClass.getSomething() // will return 'yes'
```

2) Legacy package removal

Groovy 3 provided duplicate versions of numerous classes (in old and new packages) to allow Groovy users to migrate towards the new [JPMS](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/features/understanding-java-9-modules.html) compliant package names - see [the section about it in Groovy 3 Release Notes](http://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.html#Groovy3.0releasenotes-Splitpackages) for more details. Groovy 4 no longer provides the duplicate legacy classes.

For backwards compatibility reasons ScriptRunner still ships with deprecated version of `groovy.util.XmlSlurper` and `groovy.xml.XmlParser`. We recommend you don't use these legacy classes going forward and use their equivalents that can be found in `groovy.xml` package.

3) Changes related to how Groovy code accesses private fields from within closures

Groovy developers are currently attempting to improve how its code accesses private fields in certain scenarios, where such access is expected but problematic. For example, within closure definitions where subclasses or inner classes are involved ( [GROOVY-5438](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-5438)). You may notice breakages in Groovy 4 code in such scenarios until they fix this issue.

4) Change to `intersect` () default Groovy method

`intersect()` default Groovy method used to draw elements from the second argument passed to it, but now it draws elements from the first argument passed to it - see [GROOVY-10275](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-10275).

5) Error message for users using `@Grab` to import certain libraries

There has been a breaking change for users using `@Grab` to import certain libraries. Check out the [Groovy 4 Breaking Change for Grab Annotations](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/release-notes/breaking-changes/groovy-4-breaking-change-for-grab-annotations) page for more information on this breaking change and solutions on how to fix it.

### Deprecated SrSpecification class removed

Authors of [Script Plugins](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/best-practices/write-code/create-a-script-plugin) may be used to writing tests which extend the deprecated `com.onresolve.scriptrunner.canned.common.admin.SrSpecification` class. This class has been removed. Authors of tests for their scripts should extend the `spock.lang.Specification` class directly. The [Test Runner Built-in Script](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/best-practices/write-and-run-tests#test-runner-built-in-script--en) should still pick up tests as normal.

### HAPI update

We've made a breaking change related to retrieving the customer request type. Find out more details in the [HAPI Changelog](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/release-notes/hapi-changelog#m-800--en).

#### New Features

-   SRPLAT-2179 - Support for JDK 17
