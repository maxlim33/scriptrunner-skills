## Disable/Enable Features

If you are having issues with a specific feature of ScriptRunner, we suggest disabling all ScriptRunner scripts for that feature and re-enabling one-by-one to identify the source of the problem. For example, to troubleshoot behaviours:

1.  Navigate to Behaviours.
2.  Click the Cog drop-down under _Operations_.
3.  Select Disable from the list.
4.  Repeat this for all configured behaviours.
5.  Re-enable behaviours one-by-one and test.

## XML Storage

If Adaptavist Support requests the XML text for your behaviour, please follow the below instructions.

### 6.0+

1.  Navigate to ScriptRunner > Behaviours.
2.  Click Edit next to the affected behaviour.
    
3.  Copy the behaviour ID from the URL; this is the last number in the URL. For example, for the behaviour with the following URL, the ID is `1`:
    
    ```
    <JiraBaseURL>/plugins/servlet/scriptrunner/admin/behaviours/edit/1
    ```
    
4.  Open a new browser tab, and enter the following REST API call, where `<behaviourID>` is the ID from the behaviour URL:
    
    ```
    <JiraBaseURL>/rest/scriptrunner/behaviours/latest/config/<behaviourID>
    ```
    
    For example:
    
    ```
    jira.example.com/rest/scriptrunner/behaviours/latest/config/1
