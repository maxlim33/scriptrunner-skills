ScriptRunner for Jira is an app available on the Atlassian Marketplace that allows you to extend Jira functionality using built-in and custom Groovy scripts.

ScriptRunner allows you to extend basic Jira functionality, such as JQL, and use scripted [JQL functions](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/jql-functions). It also allows you to automate using [escalation services](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/jobs/built-in-jobs/escalation-services) and [workflow functions](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/workflows). You can build scripted fields to show calculated data or use [Behaviours](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/behaviours) to customize how you create and update issues.

Out-of-the-box, you can find several [built-in scripts](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/built-in-scripts) ready to go, or you may want to create custom scripts using Groovy and [HAPI](../uncategorized/h/hapi.md) (our very own API).

Tip: To reach the _Script_ _Console_ in the above screenshot, you need Jira administration permissions. You can reach this screen through the _Administration_ menu.

## Who has access?

ScriptRunner is managed by a Jira administrator, however many users can use its functions. You may not even know you are using a ScriptRunner function, or working through a script condition in a workflow, because of how seamlessly it integrates.

We recommend creating a generic user to carry out some of the automated functions—a user that won't get confused with actual users in your Jira instance.

### Example

At Great Adventure, they have created a user named Tobor. Tobor is a Jira administrator, so he can handle all of the back-end functions that ScriptRunner carries out.

Tobor does consume a license for any of the applications he needs access to; however, by using this generic account, Great Adventure gets clarification on what actions are automated vs. what actions are completed by an actual user in Jira.

## ScriptRunner for Jira or just plain old Jira?

While Jira includes many tools that can help automate, report, and move your issues through from start to finish, ScriptRunner does just a bit more! Let's compare a few items to see what you can do in Jira and then in ScriptRunner. Of course, this list is not everything ScriptRunner can do.

| Feature | Jira capability | ScriptRunner for Jira capability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JQL | In Jira, you can use JQL to search for issues and create filters. You also use JQL in Service Management queues and SLAs, as well as to power Software boards. | With ScriptRunner, you can use scripted JQL functions to extend what you can do with basic JQL, including the ability to calculate data through the scripted JQL. |
| Workflow functions | In Jira, you can use workflow functions to control who does what with issues in a workflow, or automate some actions after a transition has completed. | With ScriptRunner, you can use workflow functions to further extend these control and automation capabilities, allowing you to manage issues at a more detailed level. |
| Custom fields | In Jira, you can create custom fields to capture more information on your issues. | With ScriptRunner, you can create scripted custom fields that allow you to include calculations in a field. For example you can use a custom field to display the date and time the issue had its status changed. |

So, as you see, ScriptRunner adds some great features to Jira that can help you work more efficiently and with better information.
