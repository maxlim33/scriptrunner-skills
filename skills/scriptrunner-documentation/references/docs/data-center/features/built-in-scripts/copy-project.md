Use the _Copy Projects_ built-in script to create a new project based on the configuration of an existing project in the Jira instance, allowing administration users to quickly and efficiently create projects without the need for timely manual configuration. This script copies the following to a new project:

-   Schemes
-   Role memberships
-   Custom field configurations
-   Agile boards related to the project (Optional)
-   Filters and dashboards that begin with the project key (Optional)
    
    Tip: This is useful when processes require giving new users a tailored dashboard and a set of filters related to their project.
    
-   Versions (Optional)
-   Components (Optional)
-   Issues and their attachments (Optional. Components and Versions must be selected)
    
    Tip: This is useful for creating template projects with issues and template documents.
    
    Note: When copying issues, all links on issues in the source project will be copied exactly, with one exception: Intra-project links are reproduced on the respective issues in the copied project. For example, if you are copying project A to project B, and issue A1 depends on A2, then B1 will depend on B2.
    
    Warning: Be aware that issue statuses are not copied with the project. All issues are reset to the create state.
