Use the _Change Dashboard, Filter, or Board Ownership_ built-in script to change the owner of the selected [dashboards](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver100/managing-dashboards-1442846260.html), [filters](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver100/managing-filters-1442846255.html), and [board](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwareserver/what-is-a-board-938845235.html) s from one user to another.

For example, if a team member has left your company, you could use this built-in script to transfer all dashboard and filter ownerships at once before deactivating the user.

Note: Depending on the configuration and share settings, a user might still have access to a dashboard, filter, or board after ownership has changed.

## Dashboard ownership transfer rules

Dashboards comprise gadgets or portlets that use filters. When dashboard ownership changes, any filters within the dashboard will error; therefore the filter ownership needs to be changed as well. This built-in script changes ownership of any filters contained within the affected dashboard using the following rules:

-   If the dashboard being modified includes filters with the same owner, the filter owner is also modified.
-   If a different user owns the filter and the target user has permission to view the filter, no change is made.
-   If a different user owns the filter and the target user does not have permission to view the filter, the filter is shared globally.

## Using this built-in script

1.  From ScriptRunner, navigate to Built-in Scripts > Change dashboard, filter, or board ownership.
2.  For From user, select username of the person you wish to transfer ownership away from.
3.  For To user, select username of the person you wish to transfer ownership away to.
    
    Note: In the Dashboards, Filters, and Boards fields, all dashboards, filters or boards by the user specified in From User are listed.
    
4.  Select the name of the dashboard/s you want to transfer to the new owner.
5.  Select the name of the filter/s you want to transfer to the new owner.
6.  Select the name of the board/s you want to transfer to the new owner.
    
    Tip: To select multiple dashboards, filters, and boards, hold Ctrl (Command on macOS) while selecting options.
    
7.  Select Preview to see an overview before committing changes. Select Run to change ownership.
