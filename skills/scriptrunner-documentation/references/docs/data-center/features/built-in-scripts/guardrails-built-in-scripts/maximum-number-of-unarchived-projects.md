## Reporting

This built-in script returns all projects that have not been updated a specified amount of time. For example, you can choose to display projects that haven't been updated in 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or a time length specified by you.

You can also use the Project filter to archive the projects that fit the criteria of the script.

3.  If you wish to filter projects, enter a script into the Project filter script console.
    
    You can select Example scripts to display examples that target projects, for example, though categories, names, or the project lead.
    
4.  Select Preview to display the projects that match the criteria you have specified.

## Restoring archived projects

If you accidentally archived a project and wish to restore it, see how to [restore and re-index a project](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/archiving-a-project-938847621.html?_ga=2.80998487.1773378735.1662365190-2029362582.1658496808&_gac=1.251470514.1661247955.EAIaIQobChMIrO_L8Nbc-QIV0OR3Ch0eUwuIEAAYASAAEgIqx_D_BwE#Archivingaproject-Restoringandre-indexingaproject) in the Atlassian documentation.

## Archiving tip

### Delete archived projects after a set amount of time

We recommend that you delete archived projects if they haven't been restored or asked about since X months/years after archiving. The amount of time depends on your company policy when it comes to such matters. This is a process you can set up automatically with ScriptRunner, or perform manually.
