## Getting form fields

### getFieldById(fieldId)

Get a FormField object to retrieve the value, set the validity, etc.

```
getFieldById("customfield_11111")
getFieldById("summary")
```

### getFieldByName(fieldName)

This is the same as above example but uses the name.

Note: Multi-language instances

`getFieldByName` is language-specific API. If you have a multi-language instance, we recommend you use `getFieldById` instead.

```
getFieldByName("My Custom Field")
getFieldByName("Description")
```

### getFieldChanged()

Gets the ID of the field that this script is attached to.

```
getFieldById(getFieldChanged())
```

## Common field operations

### formField.getValue()

Gets the value that is current in the form. For certain fields, this does do some conversions.

-   Select fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc. the string value will be returned, or a List of string values.
-   Versions or Components fields the Version or Component objects(s) will be returned.
-   Linked Issues field (id: "issuelinks-issues") will always return an array, even an empty one.

### formField.setError(errorStr)

Marks the field as having an error. The error text is shown below the field. The user cannot submit while there are fields with errors.

```
formField.setError("The user selected is not a component lead")
```

### formField.clearError()

Removes the error status from the field. Make sure that if you set an error, you also clear it for valid values.

### formField.setLabel()

Sets a different "name" for the field. This only affects the visual appearance of the field. It doesn't alter further calls to getFieldByName

```
formField.setLabel('Why is this high priority?')
```

### formField.setRequired(boolean)

Makes this a required field or not.

```
formField.setRequired(true)
```

### formField.setHidden(boolean)

Hides a field, or shows a hidden field. For example when the user selects Other from a select list, display a text field for them to type the value.

```
formField.setHidden(true)
```

### formField.setReadOnly(boolean)

Makes a field read-only ( `true`), or writable ( `false`).

```
formField.setReadOnly(true)
```

### formField.setFormValue(value)

Sets the value in the form. Unless you also set this to readonly, a user can modify it subsequently.

```
formField.setFormValue("Documentation subtask")
```

-   For "picker" fields you need to provide the ID of the option.
-   For Assets fields you need to provide object key. See [Work with Assets](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/hapi/work-with-assets) for more information on Assets.
-   For single-selects, radio buttons, multi-selects, checkboxes, project, issuetype, version, components and cascading select fields, you can provide a string matching the option label.

Note: You cannot set a value that could not exist, for instance an option that is not valid for that select list, or a component not valid for the current project. If you do this, we will log a warning in the application log. Hence it's a good idea to keep an on the application log ( `atlassian-jira.log`, when developing your behaviours).

Alternatively, you can use the actual [Option](https://docs.atlassian.com/DAC/javadoc/jira/reference/com/atlassian/jira/issue/customfields/option/Option.html) objects, or ProjectComponent, Version, Project, Resolution, which may be more useful if you are copying an existing issue.

For multi-selects and checkboxes, this should be a list of items, eg `formField.setFormValue(["Yes", "Maybe"])`

See [setting field defaults](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/behaviours/behaviours-examples/setting-field-defaults) for examples of setting values for other field types.

### formField.setFieldOptions(Iterable)

Sets the possible options for a select or multi select list. The value must be permissible for the field.

```
def customField = customFieldManager.getCustomFieldObject(getFieldChanged())
def config = customField.getRelevantConfig(getIssueContext())
def options = optionsManager.getOptions(config)
 
formField.setFieldOptions(options.findAll {it.value in ['foo', 'bar']})
```

### formField.setDescription()

Sets the description for a form field.

```
formField.setDescription("Start typing to get a list of possible users")
```

## Information about the current Issue

### getIssueContext()

Getting the current issue type and project. Returns an [com.atlassian.jira.issue.context.IssueContext](https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/latest/com/atlassian/jira/issue/context/IssueContext.html).

```
def issueTypeName = getIssueContext().issueType.name
def projectKey = getIssueContext().projectObject.name
```

### getRequestTypeName()

Get the RequestType name. If this behaviour is not running in a Service Management portal, this will return `null`.

```
if (getRequestTypeName() == 'IT Help')
```

## Workflow information

### getActionName()

Returns the name of the current action if the issue is undergoing a workflow action, null otherwise.

### getAction()

Returns an ActionDescriptor object if the issue is undergoing a workflow action, null for Edit, Assign, etc.

### getDestinationStepName()

Returns the name of the destination step if the issue is undergoing a workflow action, null otherwise.

### getDestinationStep()

Returns an StepDescriptor object for the destination step if the issue is undergoing a workflow action.

## Operations on tabs

For the following methods you can supply either the position of the tab (the leftmost one is at index 0), the tab name, or a `FieldScreenTab`.

### hideTab(Integer tabIdx / String name, FieldScreenTab tab)

Hide a tab entirely. Has an optional second parameter: specifying `false` will show the tab.

```
hideTab(1) // hides the second tab
// or
hideTab("Testing Instructions")
// or
def tab = getFieldScreen().tabs.find {it.isContainsField("summary")}
hideTab(tab)
```

### showTab(Integer tabIdx / String name, FieldScreenTab tab)

Shows a tab that was previously hidden by `hideTab`.

```
showTab(1) // shows the second tab

// you can also use
hideTab(1, false)
```

### disableTab(Integer tabIdx / String name, FieldScreenTab tab)

_Disables_ a tab - the user can see that the tab exists but cannot switch to it. This may be less confusing than hiding a tab, depending on your requirements. Has an optional second parameter, specifying `false` will enable the tab.

```
disableTab(1) // disables the second tab
```

### enableTab(Integer tabIdx / String name, FieldScreenTab tab)

Enables a tab that was previously disabled by `disableTab`.

```
enableTab(1) // enables the second tab

// you can also use
disableTab(1, false)
```

### switchTab(Integer tabIdx / String name, FieldScreenTab tab)

Switches to a tab. The primary use case for this is to control which tab is displayed when hiding or disabling a tab. If you don't use `switchTab` the tab will switch to the left-most unhidden, and enabled tab

```
hideTab(0)    // hides the first tab
switchTab(2)  // switches to the third tab
```

## Other field operations

### formField.setHelpText(helpText)

Warning: Deprecated

`setHelpText`sets an error message under the field, in the same way that`setError`does. However,`setError`prevents the form from being submitted, until`clearError`is called on the field. Using`setHelpText`makes it appear the field is in an error state, but the user is allowed to submit the form.

Because of this ambiguity,`setHelpText`is deprecated and should not be used.

To set explanatory text, use`setDescription`. If you wish to show something that looks like an error message (but does not prevent the form being submitted), you can use a CSS class or styles:

```
getFieldById('duedate').setDescription('<div class="error">foo foo</div>')
```

Add help text under a field, in response to other form events. This is useful to explain to users why fields have become mandatory. To unset it use `clearHelpText()` or `setHelpText("")`.

```
formField.setHelpText("You must enter a value for this field if you select priority Blocker")
```

### formField.setAllowInlineEdit(boolean)

Allows you to enable and disable a field so it can/cannot be edited from the issue _View_ screen. This API should only be applied to an initialiser script. Any field with a _Behaviour_ configured will have the inline edit disabled by default, which forces the user to click the pencil icon to open the edit modal form.

Warning: If you allow the inline edit of a field with a _Behaviour_ configured then a user will be able to alter the field's value on the issue _View_ screen without any of your _Behaviour_ restrictions.

#### `formField.setAllowInlineEdit(true)`

You can use `setAllowInlineEdit(true)` to enable the inline editing of a field from the issue _View_ screen. You can use this method to override the default behaviour of a field and allow inline editing of any field that has a _Behaviour_ configured to it.

#### `formFeld.setAllowInlineEdit(false)`

You can use `setAllowInlineEdit(false)` to disable the inline editing of a field from the issue _View_ screen. You will rarely use this independently, as this is the default mode for a form field with a _Behaviour_ configured to it. However, you may want to use this to disable inline editing of a field conditionally after using the above method to enable it. For example, you only want to allow inline editing for a given issue type out of several issue types that your _Behaviour_ applies to.

Note: This method only controls the field on the issue _View_ screen. To prevent a field being edited within the create, edit or transition screens use the [`setReadOnly`](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/behaviours/api-quick-reference#common-field-operations--en__formfield-setreadonly) method.

## Miscellaneous

### getRequest()

Gets the [servlet request](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html) that corresponds with this request for an initialiser, or a field-changed validator.

You might use this to get the IP address of the client, or headers that would let you determine the end-user's browser.

### getResponse()

Gets the [servlet response](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html). There is probably no cause to use this.

### setConfigParam()

Sets a specific configuration parameter.
