We've made it easy for you to specify field permissions. In the example below, we show you how to make a field mandatory if the priority field is set to _High_ or _Highest_. We also have an example on the [Behaviours Tutorial](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/behaviours/behaviours-tutorial) page that shows you how to [make a field read-only unless a user is in a specific role](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/behaviours/behaviours-tutorial#create-a-simple-behaviour-make-a-field-read-only-except-for-a-certain-role--en).

## Make a field mandatory if the priority field is a set value

This example shows you how to make a field mandatory if the priority field is a set value.

Note: Behaviours only function on the _Create Issue_, _Update/Edit Issue_, _Assign Issue_, and _Workflow Transition_ screens (see [Behaviour Limitations](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/behaviours/behaviour-limitations)). In the example below, we're adding a server-side script to a field, meaning the behaviour will run every time the field is updated.

### Scenario

To manage their high-priority issues more effectively, Great Adventure wants the _Justification_ field to be mandatory if the priority is set to _High_ or _Highest_.

Note: If you want to test this example, [add a Text Field (multi-line) custom field](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver0905/adding-custom-fields-1207177580.html#Addingcustomfields-Creatinganewcustomfield) named `Justification`.

1.  From ScriptRunner, navigate to Behaviours.
2.  Select Create Behaviour.
3.  Enter a name for the behaviour. In this case we enter `Make Justification mandatory when high priority`.
4.  Optional: Enter a description for the behaviour.
5.  Select Create Mapping.
6.  Then select the project and issue type(s) to map this behaviour to. In this case we chose the Great Adventure VTD project and All issue types.
7.  Select Add Mapping to confirm the mapping.
8.  Select Create to create the behaviour.
    
    You're taken to the Edit Behaviour screen where you can configure the behaviour further.
    
9.  Scroll to the Add Field field, select the Priority field, and then select Add.
    
    We now need to add a server-side script to the field for it to show the additional text field when someone selects _High_ or _Highest_.
    
10.  Select Create Script.
     
11.  Copy/paste the following code into the the inline script editor:
     
     ```
     import com.atlassian.jira.issue.priority.Priority
      
     def priorityField = getFieldById("priority")
     def justificationField = getFieldByName("Justification")
      
     if (((Priority) priorityField.value).name in ["High", "Highest"]) {
         justificationField.setRequired(true)
         justificationField.setHelpText("Please explain why this issue is the priority you selected.")
     } else {
         justificationField.setRequired(false)
         justificationField.setHelpText("")
     }
     ```
     
12.  Select Save Changes.

You can now test to see if this behaviour works!
