Warning: The following should be conducted in a test environment.

1.  Configure a ScriptRunner _Mail Handler_ for _Local Files_ (see [Add an Incoming Mail Handler](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/mail-handler#add-an-incoming-mail-handler--en)).
2.  Copy or write an email message in the _< jira-home>/import/mail_ folder.
    
    See [How to locate Jira Home Directory](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-locate-jira-home-directory-313466063.html) for details on how to locate your Jira home location. For more about file system messages, check the _File System Messages_ section in [Configuring Issues and Comments from Email](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver073/creating-issues-and-comments-from-email-861253784.html).
    
3.  Start with a simple script such as:
    
    ```
    import com.atlassian.mail.MailUtils
    
    def subject = message.getSubject()
    def body = MailUtils.getBody(message)
    
    log.debug "${subject}"
    log.debug "${body}"
    ```
    
4.  Click the Run Now.
    
    A _Script executed successfully_ notification appears if the mail handler ran as expected. If there is an error, an error notification appears. In the case of an unsuccessful execution, select More details link to get more information.
    
5.  Once tested, add the configuration to your Jira instance.
