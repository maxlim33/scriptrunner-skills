ScriptRunner for Jira Server provides built-in and custom workflow functions. These workflow functions include built-in and custom validators, conditions, and post functions. ScriptRunner workflow functions allow you to do a lot more with your Jira workflows and further enhance your automation.

## Jira workflow functions

As a reminder, a workflow is the series of steps through which a piece of work passes from conception to completion. In Jira, workflows are made up of two main parts; statuses and transitions. Statuses indicate that someone is working (or not working) on the issue, while transitions link statuses together. You can control several aspects of a transition's behavior in Jira. For instance, you can have:

-   Conditions that check to make sure the user should be able to perform a transition.
-   Validators which ensure that all needed changes have been made or that the changes that were made were valid.
-   Post Functions that program automated actions after the transition is performed.

These workflow functions enable a level of automation in your projects. This automation keeps your teams focused on their work, while Jira takes care of the repetitive tasks your team doesn't need to focus on. However, you may find that Jira's basic workflow functions don't always do as much as you would like them to do—and that's where ScriptRunner workflow functions come in!

Note: Jira Workflows

For more information on Jira Workflows, we recommend you familiarise yourself with the [Atlassian documentation on workflows](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/working-with-workflows-938847362.html).

## ScriptRunner workflow functions

For each of the Jira workflow functions, ScriptRunner for Jira provides built-in and custom workflow functions so that you have workflows that suit your exact needs. There are three main types of ScriptRunner workflow functions:

-   [ScriptRunner conditions](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/workflows/conditions)
-   [ScriptRunner validators](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/workflows/validators)
-   [ScriptRunner post functions](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/workflows/post-functions)

For example, you can use the [_All sub-tasks must be resolved_](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/workflows/conditions/all-sub-tasks-resolved-condition) built-in script condition to ensure that all sub-tasks have been resolved before the transition is allowed. See below for a full list of ScriptRunner workflow functions.

## Available ScriptRunner workflow conditions

The following ScriptRunner conditions are available when you add a condition to a workflow transition:

| ScriptRunner conditions | Description |

## Access ScriptRunner workflow functions

You can access ScriptRunner workflow functions as follows:

1.  Go to Administration > Issues > Workflows.
2.  Select Edit on the workflow you want to add a condition to.
3.  Select the transition you wish to add a the workflow function to.
4.  Under Options, select then workflow function or your choice.

Tip: For detailed instructions on how to navigate to ScriptRunner workflow functions, see our [documentation](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/workflows).

Your next steps depend on if you edit a workflow condition, validator, or post function. We have provided you with examples for each in the section below.

Note: Remember to publish!

Remember when editing a workflow, changes result in a draft that you must publish before you see them take effect in your workflow. Since you can use both built-in workflow functions and scripted workflow functions that you customize, there is a lot of flexibility to what you can do with ScriptRunner.
