The _Post a message to Slack_ post function allows you to send a personalized custom message to your Slack room. For example, you could be notified in a Slack channel when an issue is moved to _Done._

## Message templating

When configuring a message template for what you want to post to Slack, you can use plain text or use the [GString TemplateEngine](https://docs.groovy-lang.org/docs/next/html/documentation/template-engines.html).

The `issue` variable is available for you to use in your template. For example, you can call a property as follows:

```
"Your issue $issue has been updated."
```

You can also do more complex calls to your object by using the [<% %> notation](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/next/html/documentation/template-engines.html#_streamingtemplateengine):

```
"The issue $issue, which is assigned to <% out << issue.assignee %>, was updated."
```
