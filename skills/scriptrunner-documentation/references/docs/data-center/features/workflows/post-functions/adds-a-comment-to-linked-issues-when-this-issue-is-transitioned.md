Use _Adds a Comment to Linked Issues when this Issue is Transitioned_ to automatically add a custom comment to linked issues after the selected issue is transitioned. For example, you can use this post function if you want to add a comment on a service desk request when the development issue that causes the request has been transitioned to _Done_.

## Build a comment

When writing a comment, you can include static text (text that doesn't change) and dynamic content (text that changes based on the issue's properties or context). Below are some examples of how to write a comment with dynamic content.

### Reference the current issue key

```
This is a comment related to issue ${issue.key}.
```

### Reference the current issue summary

```
The issue titled '${issue.summary}' has been updated.
```

### Reference the current issue resolution

Tip: For this example to work as expected, make sure the post function sits after the post function that updates the resolution of the issue. Check out our documentation on [Post function order](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/workflows/post-functions/custom-post-functions#post-function-order--en) for more information.

```
The issue has been resolved with the resolution: <% out << issue.resolution?.name %>.
```

### Reference the assignee's display name

```
The issue is now assigned to <% out << issue.assignee?.displayName %>
```
