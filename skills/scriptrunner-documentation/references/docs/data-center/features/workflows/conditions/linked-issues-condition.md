Use the _Linked issues condition_ to control whether or not a user can transition an issue based on the status or resolution of linked issues. There are several options available when setting up the _Linked Issues Condition_, and these are described below.

## Status vs resolution check

The Status indicates an issue's position in its workflow, while Resolution specifies why an issue is closed. The _Linked issues condition_ allows you to check the status or resolution of linked issues before an issue can be transitioned.

### Status check

The Status radio button allows you to control the transition based on the status of any linked issues. If the Status option is selected, the transition is only allowed if _all_ linked issues of the selected link directions are in _any_ of the selected statuses.

For example, you want to only allow the transition of a story to _Done_ if all _is blocked by_ or _is caused by_ linked issues are in the _Done_ status.

Note: Use the Invert condition checkbox to reverse the above condition logic

### Resolution check

The Resolution radio button allows you to control the transition based on the resolution of the linked issues. If the Resolution option is selected, two options are available:

-   Any Resolution - Allows the transition if linked issues (of the specified link type) have _any_ resolution.
-   Select Resolution(s) - Allows the transition if linked issues (of the specified link type) have any specified resolution.

For example, you want to only allow the transition of an Epic to _Done_ if all the issues in the epic and epic subtasks have a resolution.

Alternatively, you want to only allow an Epic to transition to _Done_ when all issues in the epic and epic subtasks have the resolution _Done_.

Note: Use the Invert condition checkbox to reverse the above condition logic

The is epic of link direction can be used to control the ability to transition an epic based on the issues shown in the Issues in Epic section of the epic.

The subtask link direction can be used to control the parent issues ability to transition based on the linked subtasks.
