This condition checks that the selected fields have a value before it can transition in a workflow. If any of the specified fields are empty, the issue can not transition.

For example:

-   You want to ensure the system field Fix Version/s field has a value before the issue can be transitioned to _Done._
-   You have a Purchase Order Number database picker field, you want this to be completed before the issue can transition to _In Progress_.

## Use this condition

To set up a Field(s) Required condition do the following:

1.  Go to Administration > Issues > Workflows.
2.  Select Edit on the workflow you want to add a condition to.
3.  Select the transition to which you wish to add a condition.
4.  Under Options, select Conditions.
    
5.  On the _Transition_ page, select Add condition.
6.  Select Field(s) required condition.
7.  Optional: Enter a description of the condition in Note.
8.  Optional: Enter a Condition for which the condition fires. If you leave this blank the condition will run on all issues in the workflow.
