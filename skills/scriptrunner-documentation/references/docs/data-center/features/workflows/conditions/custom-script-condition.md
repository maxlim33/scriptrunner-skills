Use the _Custom script condition_ to run an embedded script that determines whether an issue should be permitted to transition to a particular status within a workflow. This condition allows you to write Groovy scripts that can evaluate a wide range of conditions based on issue fields, workflow states, project properties, user permissions, and other contextual data.

Tip: With the introduction of [HAPI](../../../uncategorized/h/hapi.md), you can do what the _Custom Script Condition_ does but in fewer lines when using our [Simple Scripted Condition](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/workflows/conditions/simple-scripted-condition) built-in workflow function. We therefore recommend, where possible, to use the _Simple Scripted Condition_ over the _Custom Script Condition_.

If you need help writing your script, check out the [Scripting tips](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/best-practices/write-code/scripting-tips) page.

## Use this condition

### Condition functions

Condition functions determine if a transition should be visible for a particular issue. Jira runs condition functions frequently, it's therefore important to avoid doing any long processing in them.

To control whether a transition is permitted, you must set a variable named `passesCondition` to `true` or `false`. By default, `passesCondition` is `true`, meaning the action will be allowed unless you explicitly set it otherwise.

### Step-by-step instructions

1.  Go to Administration > Issues > Workflows.
2.  Select Edit on the workflow you want to add a condition to.
3.  Select the transition to which you wish to add a condition.
4.  Under Options, select Conditions.
5.  On the _Transition_ page, select Add condition.
6.  Select Custom script condition.
7.  Select Add.
8.  Optional: Enter a note that describes the condition.
9.  Enter an inline script of your choice.
10.  Optional: Select Preview.
11.  Select Update.
12.  Select Publish and choose if you want to save a backup copy of the workflow.
     
     You can now test to see if this workflow condition works.
