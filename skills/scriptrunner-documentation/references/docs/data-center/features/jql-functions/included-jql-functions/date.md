This page provides information on functions used to search for issues by date:

-   [Compare dates on an issue (dateCompare)](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features#compare-dates-on-an-issue-datecompare--en)
-   [Find issues by the user who last updated them (lastUpdated)](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features#find-issues-by-the-user-who-last-updated-them-lastupdated--en)

## Compare dates on an issue (dateCompare)

Use `dateCompare` to compare dates on an issue:

```
issueFunction in dateCompare("Subquery", "date comparison expression")
```

Note: Supported operators

The comparison operators available in this function are `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `=`. The use of the " `!=` " operator when using the `dateCompare` function is only supported on ScriptRunner for Jira Cloud. However, you can achieve the same result by using " `=` " and negating the JQL clause itself in ScriptRunner for Jira Server/DC.

### Supported date fields

The following date fields are supported by this function:

-   `created`
-   `dueDate`
-   `resolutionDate`
-   `firstCommented`. This is a hidden ScriptRunner field for the `dateCompare` JQL that gets the date of the first comment on an issue.
-   `lastCommented`. This is a hidden ScriptRunner field for the `dateCompare` JQL that gets the date of the last comment on an issue.
-   Date picker custom fields
-   Date Time Picker custom fields

Tip: Custom field names

When using the `dateCompare()` function, custom fields with multiple words (such as _Delivery Date_) do not require quotation marks in the date comparison expression. The function recognizes these multi-word field names without additional formatting. For example:

```
issueFunction in dateCompare("", "resolutionDate > Delivery Date")
```

### Examples

We want to find all issues that were resolved later than their due date:

```
issueFunction in dateCompare("", "resolutionDate > dueDate")
```

Tip: Time windows

You can use time windows on either side of your expression. For example, to find issues resolved before or up to one week after their due date:

```
issueFunction in dateCompare("", "resolutionDate < dueDate +1w")
```

We want to find issues that were resolved within two weeks of creation:

```
issueFunction in dateCompare("", "created +2w > resolutionDate ")
```

We want to find issues that have not been commented on within one week of creation:

```
issueFunction in dateCompare("", "created +1w < firstCommented ")
```

We want to find issues that were resolved after their chosen delivery date:

Note: In this example, _Delivery Date_ is a Date Picker custom field.

```
issueFunction in dateCompare("", "resolutionDate > Delivery Date")
```

We want to find issues that were resolved on their chosen delivery date:

```
issueFunction in dateCompare("", "resolutionDate = Delivery Date")
```

#### Performance

Performance will be impacted by the number of issues that have both fields in the date comparison expression. If this is a very high number of issues (greater than 50k) you can filter some out with a subquery, for example:

```
issueFunction in dateCompare("project in myProjects()", "resolutionDate > dueDate")
```

## Find issues by the user who last updated them (lastUpdated)

Use lastUpdated() to find issues by the user who last updated them:

```
issueFunction in lastUpdated("user query")
```

This function includes the following actions when searching for issues:

-   Edits
-   State changes
-   Adding/removing links, labels etc.
-   Commenting

### Supported arguments

The following arguments are supported when writing your user query:

-   `by` username or user function
    
    For example `"by admin"` or `"by currentUser()"`.
    
-   `inRole` role
    
    For example `"inRole Administrators"`.
    
-   `inGroup` group
    
    For example `"inGroup jira-administrators"`.
    

### Example

We want to find all issues that were last updated by members of the _Administrators_ role: 

```
issueFunction in lastUpdated('inRole Administrators')
```
