This listener adds the current user (the user performing the action) as a watcher on the issue. You may want to:

-   Add all users logging work in the issue as watchers.
-   Add the current user as a watcher if they edit the issue and set the priority to _Highest_.

This listener is similar to using the _Participants_ field in the notification scheme, however, using a listener allows people to remove themselves as watchers if required.

1.  Select the Adds the current user as a watcher built-in listener.
2.  Enter a description of the listener in Name.
3.  Define which project(s) the listener should be Applied to.
    
    You can either check _Global_ to apply the listener to all projects or check _Select projects(s)_ and define the projects you want to assign the listener to.
    
4.  Select the Events on which the listener fires.
    
    For example, to add any user who edits the issue as a watcher, choose the Issue Updated event.
    
5.  You can further refine this by entering a Condition, for instance, if you wanted to restrict this behaviour to just certain components or certain priorities of issue.
6.  Select Add.
