Use this listener to send an email based on a Jira non-issue event and custom condition. Non-issue events include:

-   Create a project
-   Add a new user
-   Update a component
-   Third-party plugin events

Note: This listener is similar to the [Send a Custom Email](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/listeners/built-in-listeners/send-a-custom-email) listener and [Send a Custom Email](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/workflows/post-functions/send-a-custom-email) post function.

This listener has multiple elements to it:

-   Applied to: Choose if you want to apply this listener to specific or all projects in your instance.
-   Events: Choose the non-issue event/s this listener will fire on.
-   Condition and configuration: Set a condition to control when this listener fires. You can also pass additional variables to the body and subject templates using the `config` map, and dynamically control recipients using the `mail` variable. See [Send a custom email](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/listeners/built-in-listeners/send-a-custom-email) for more information on configuring custom emails.
-   Email template: Write an email template using plain text or the [GStringTemplateEngine](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/docs/next/html/documentation/template-engines.html).
-   Subject template: Write the subject template using plain text or the [GStringTemplateEngine](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/docs/next/html/documentation/template-engines.html).
-   Email format: Choose whether to send the email as plain text or HTML.
-   To addresses/To Groups: Choose who to send the email to.
-   CC addresses/CC Groups: Choose who should be CC'd on the email.
-   Reply-to email address: Set the email address for replies.

Note: Prerequisite

You must [configure an SMTP mail server](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/configuring-an-smtp-mail-server-to-send-notifications-947184044.html) to send mail.

## Condition and configuration example

In the _Condition and configuration_ code editor you can enter a condition to ensure certain conditions are met before the email is sent. You can also use this code editor to pass additional variables to the _Email template_ and _Subject template_ using the `config` map, and dynamically control recipients using the `mail` variable. For example, we want to send an email after a version is released. In this example, the selected event will be `VersionReleaseEvent` and the script in the Condition and Configuration field will be:

```
import com.atlassian.jira.event.project.VersionReleaseEvent
 
def versionReleaseEvent = event as VersionReleaseEvent
def version = versionReleaseEvent.version
 
// Store in the config map, the version and the project name so we can use them later in our templates
config.'versionName' = version.name
config.'projectName' = version.project.name
true
```

We can use the above variables in our _Email_ and _Subject_ and templates, for example the Email template would be:

```
Version $config.versionName for project $projectName just released.
 
Congratulations!
```

     Warning: If you are facing issues with characters appearing as question marks (???) then, in most cases, problems are due to a misconfiguration in the encoding, see [Jira Application internationalization and encoding troubleshooting](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/jira-application-internationalisation-and-encoding-troubleshooting-203394762.html) .
