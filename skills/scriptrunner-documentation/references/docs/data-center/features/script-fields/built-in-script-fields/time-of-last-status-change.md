Use this built-in script field to display the date and time an issue's status was last changed. For example, if an issue's status was last changed from _To-do_ to _Done_, this field will display when this change occurred.

Note: This script field will display a status change if the status of an issue is transitioned to the same status, for example from To-do to To-do.
