Learn about Fetch API, a JavaScript interface used for making asynchronous HTTP requests across a network.

ScriptRunner Connect offers [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) as the lowest level API for making API calls over HTTP. While we recommend using [Managed APIs](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/workspaces/package-manager#managed-apis--en) if available, Fetch API is a valid alternative if you cannot use Managed APIs for whatever reason. Managed APIs also offer [Managed Fetch API](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/managed-apis/managed-api-abstractions#managed-fetch-api--en), which can be combined with the [generic connector](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/connectors/generic-connector) to great effect.

Note: Compliance

ScriptRunner Connect's Fetch API implementation is not fully compliant with the specification because the Fetch API was originally designed to work in a browser and not in server-side JavaScript runtime, which is where ScriptRunner Connect code is executed.

## Demo

## Fetch options

```
{
    method?: string; // Method for the Fetch call
    headers?: Headers | Record<string, string>; // Headers to be passed along
    body?: Blob | ArrayBuffer | FormData | string | null; // Body to be passed along
    agent?: {
        rejectUnauthorized?: boolean; // Whether to reject invalid HTTPS connection, defaults to true
        ca?: string | ArrayBuffer | (string | ArrayBuffer)[]; // CA certificate to be used with HTTPS connection (must be in PEM format)
        cert: string | ArrayBuffer | (string | ArrayBuffer)[]; // Certificate to be used with HTTPS connection (must be in PEM format)
        key? string | ArrayBuffer | (string | ArrayBuffer)[]; // Private key to be used with HTTPS connection (must be in PEM format)
        passphrase?: string; // Use to decrypt certificates, if certificates are not encrypted, don't specify it
    }
}
```

## Custom headers

ScriptRunner Connect exposes many custom headers with the `x-stitch` prefix.

### Request headers

-   x-stitch-connection-id
    
    Used internally by Managed APIs to pass along the API connection used with the Managed API call. This value is the UID of the API connection.
    
-   x-stitch-ignore-ssl-check
    
    Disables check for invalid HTTPS connection and does the same thing as `rejectUnauthorized` when passed along with the `agent` option.
    

### Response headers

-   x-stitch-time
    
    Time in milliseconds it took to perform the actual HTTP call, which is more accurate than measuring how long it took to perform the HTTP call from the code.
    

## Mutual TLS

You can perform [mutual TLS](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/) by passing `ca`, `cert`, `key` and `passphrase` options with the agent option in the fetch call.

Note: An example 👀
