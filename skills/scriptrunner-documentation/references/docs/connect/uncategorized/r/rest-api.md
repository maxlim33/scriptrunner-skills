ScriptRunner Connect offers a RESTful API to help you accomplish more with the app.

You can create new API keys and access existing ones from the app by clicking your name at the bottom-left corner of the screen and then clicking API Keys.

Note: Base URL ℹ️

The base URLs are [https://api.scriptrunnerconnect.com](https://api.scriptrunnerconnect.com/) for the EU region and [https://api.us.scriptrunnerconnect.com](https://api.us.scriptrunnerconnect.com/) for the US region.

Note: Limited API coverage 🚧

API coverage is currently limited, but it is expected to grow over time. Feel free to [contact our support](https://the-adaptavist-group-support.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/20/user/login) to request more capabilities.

## Authentication

ScriptRunner Connect API utilizes [basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) where the user's email address is the `username` and the API key is the `passwordz`. To generate an API key, click on your name in the bottom left area of the screen, then select API Keys. From there, you can generate a new API key.

Once you have the API key, send it along with the `Authorization` header as follows: `Basic base64Encoded(UserName:ApiKey)`. When you generate the API Key, you will also receive the base64 encoded `Authorization` header value, which you can use directly.

Tip: Single key per activity ☝🏽

We recommend generating a new key for each activity. This makes it easier to deactivate the activity by deleting the associated API key.

Note: API keys are not retrievable 💾

Once the key is generated, make a copy and store it securely. Once you have closed the window that exposed the API key, you won't be able to retrieve it again.

## Call the API from ScriptRunner Connect

Although we currently don't offer a connector or a managed API for our own API, you can call API endpoints from a workspace with the [generic connector](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/connectors/generic-connector).

## Rate limits

API endpoints are rate-limited; see [Limits and Quotas](../l/limits-and-quotas.md) to review the exact limits. If throttled, you'll see a `429` HTTP status code; retry the API call at a later time.
