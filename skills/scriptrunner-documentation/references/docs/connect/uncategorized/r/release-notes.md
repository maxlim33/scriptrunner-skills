Information on the latest released versions of ScriptRunner Connect.

Here are the changes we document in the Release Notes:

-   New features: Brand new functionality designed to make ScriptRunner Connect an exceptional app.
-   Updates: Changes we've made, large and small, that we want you to be aware of.
-   Bug Fixes: Issues we've resolved to make ScriptRunner Connect work as intended.

## 21 September 2026

### Public API now covers most of the app's functionality.

As part of this expansion, a few bugs with existing API endpoints were fixed, which may result in breaking changes in some cases. Most of the changes are related to response status code which shouldn't constitute a breaking change as long as you were checked at whether the response is OK (200-299 range) or not.

Pay attention to the following changes which may break your existing behaviour:

-   `/v1/team/{teamId}/invocationLogs`:
    -   `dropped` filed was renamed to `dropReason`.
    -   `orderBy` query param now only accepts: `workspace`, `environment`, `duration`, `consoleLogs`, `httpLogs` and `startTime`, in a case-sensitive manner.
    -   Unrecognised `executionStatuses` or `triggerTypes` now error out, rather than being silently ignored.
    -   `pageSize` must now be a numeric value; previously coercion was used (same applies to `/v1/team/{teamId}/auditLogs endpoint`)

• `/v1/invocation/{id}/consoleLogs`, `…/httpLogs`, and `…/largeLogMessage/{msgId}:` previously, this endpoint returned 200 even when there were no logs saved, now it returns 404 when invocation has no logs, which usually means the invocation hasn't finished running or something else happened to it. It also now returns a successful response even with an empty content when the invocation didn't emit any logs (previously it return 200 for no logs scenario but the provided URL failed to be downloaded)

## 20 July 2026

### Update

We've expanded our [REST API](https://docs.api.scriptrunnerconnect.com/#/) to include endpoints, for working with event listeners.

## 02 March 2026

### New features

We've added [FIFO Event Queue](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/workspaces/event-queues), which allows processing incoming events sequentially rather than concurrently, reducing the risk of race conditions.

## 24 February 2026

### Update

We have a very exciting update to share! ✨

## 21 November 2025

### New features

We have a cool new feature to share:

To avoid the tedious task of recreating the same or similar parameters across environments in the workspace, we've created the ability to [duplicate parameters](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/workspaces/parameters). This feature is available in the _Parameters_ section of every environment.

## 03 November 2025

### New features

We have 3 wonderful new features to tell you about:

This new feature is available across all pricing plans at no additional cost.

We made improvements to our Parameters feature for a better developer experience:

-   You can now use Monaco code completion to show which parameters have been created in your workspace, rather than checking the parameters tab to see which are defined.
-   Parameters are now typed, allowing you to use related methods without casting the parameters to their type.

## 10 March 2025

### New features

We have 2 new AI-related features to share!

### AI Explain Error 🔎

A new feature has been added to help you resolve errors in the console. The AI Explain Error feature uses our AI assistant to help you understand the context and specific error message when one is displayed in the console. You'll be able to send or omit the relevant code with the error message when prompted to use this feature.

### AI Explain Code 📍

To have our AI assistant help you by explaining a section of code, simply highlight the relevant section with your cursor and select the AI Explain Code option after a right-click in the same area.

## 13 February 2025

### New feature

### Public REST API ⚡

An initial set of [REST API](rest-api.md) endpoints were released that now allow query script invocation and audit logs from ScriptRunner Connect. If you want to store our logs longer than we are or would like to push logs to your third-party systems for analytical or monitoring and alerting purposes, you now have this option. To illustrate how to go about querying our logs, we have an accompanying [template](https://templates.scriptrunnerconnect.com/template/backup-sr-connect-logs-into-aws-s3) that periodically creates a backup of script invocation logs in AWS S3.

## 04 February 2025

### Update

We updated the templates screen with two new filtering categories, _Use cases_ and _Complexity,_ to help you find relevant listings! 🔍

We've introduced audit logs to provide visibility into user actions within ScriptRunner Connect. This new feature allows you to view historical actions for yourself and your teammates, provided you have the appropriate access.

In the app, navigate to _Reporting > Audit Logs_ to review logged activities. Users can see logs relevant to their own actions; admins and super admins can access logs for their respective teams.

-   Retention: Logs are stored for six months before being automatically deleted.
-   Key fields: Each log includes details like the actor, action performed, IP address, timestamp, related entities, and more.
-   Export options: Logs can be exported as CSV files for further analysis, with team-based filters applied.

Read more in the _Reporting_ section on the [Audit Logs](../../observability/audit-logs.md) page.

## 29 August 2024

### Update

We've made a small update to the generic connector. Previously, if you specified an HTTP header in a fetch call that was also defined at the connector level, the connector's header would take precedence, overriding the fetch-level header. With this update, the logic has been reversed: now, the fetch-level header will overwrite the connector-level header. Please note that this change applies only to generic connectors.

See the [Generic Connector](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/connectors/generic-connector) page for more info.

## 16 August 2024

We have a cool new feature to tell you about:

### New feature

### Console Log 🔍

When you perform an action in a workspace, run a script manually, or trigger a script through a scheduled or external event, the related logs will appear in the console log.

See [Console Log](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/workspaces/console-log) to learn all about it, including how to filter and refine the log messages to find precisely what you're looking for.

### Update

-   ScriptRunner Connect is now fully [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) and [SOC Type 2](https://www.imperva.com/learn/data-security/soc-2-compliance/) certified! 🥳 🥂
-   We added the [Convert Data Types](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/scripting/convert-data-types) topic.

## 27 June 2024

### New feature

We have a cool new feature to tell you about:

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 🔒

After popular demand, we're happy to announce the addition of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance the security of ScriptRunner Connect! Next time you log in, you will receive a prompt asking whether you want to enable MFA.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a multi-step login process that enhances security by requiring users to provide more information than just a username and password. To log in with MFA enabled, you'll use a one-time password (OTP) generated from an authenticator app. Popular options include Authy, Google Authenticator, Auth0 Guardian, and Microsoft Authenticator, all of which can be downloaded from the Google Play or Apple app stores.

You can manage your MFA preference in your profile settings:

### Update

We created a way for you to work more efficiently with large attachments when not using managed APIs. [Read all about it](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/scripting/code-snippets/working-with-attachments).

### Vendor API versions for Confluence Cloud and monday.com connectors! ⚡

Confluence Cloud and monday.com API connectors now include a Vendor API Version field, allowing you to choose which base API version you want to use with ScriptRunner Connect's Managed APIs. If needed, you can use multiple versions in your workspace by creating multiple API connections with different base versions.

### Updates

We improved the [Sync ServiceNow Incidents with Jira Cloud Issues](https://app.scriptrunnerconnect.com/template/01GMT114JSESH9PQRYX18X3A8W) template in the following ways:

-   The template now supports attachments.
-   The template now allows you to start the sync from either ServieNow or Jira Cloud (rather than only from Jira Cloud).
-   The template now instructs you to create a custom field to hold the ServiceNow ID rather than storing it in the comments.

Find this and all other templates on our [Templates](../t/templates.md) page! ✨

## 17 May 2024

We have 3 wonderful new features to tell you about:

### New template for Jira 💪🏾

We created a new template for Jira users, [Keep Jira On-Prem issues in sync with Jira Cloud](https://app.scriptrunnerconnect.com/template/01HNFNQMDF7G1N8Y34D2SDPDDD).

Tip: Just Cloud? ☁

If you want to sync data between multiple Jira Cloud instances, check out the [Keep Jira Cloud issues in sync](https://app.scriptrunnerconnect.com/template/01GYW8F8WHZ8SAFCNVBAQY16D8) template.

### Environment variables 🌱

We are also excited to announce that [Environment variables are live](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/workspaces/parameters)!

This new feature lets you securely manage and utilize environment-specific settings and configurations for more modular, secure, and easy-to-maintain code.

### Notifications for script failures 📨

Finally, you can now receive email notifications when scripts fail. To opt-in, just make the following quick update to your ScriptRunner Connect profile:

## 22 March 2024

### Updates

We created a handy new Slack template, [Holidaytron4000](https://app.scriptrunnerconnect.com/template/01HSB7YF3QQRW2J1X821QZX5GA)! 🤖

The template periodically checks BambooHR and then posts your teammates' holiday/PTO summaries to a Slack channel.

## 02 February 2024

### Updates

-   We improved the [Jira Cloud to Jira Cloud sync template](https://app.scriptrunnerconnect.com/template/01GYW8F8WHZ8SAFCNVBAQY16D8) to cover more use cases. Check it out!

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed a bug in our runtime where the output string from the [atob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/atob) function was erroneously encoded with UTF-8; now it's correctly encoded with [latin1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1).
-   Started releasing version 2.0.0 of Managed APIs, incorporating a non-backwards-compatible bug fix. Specifically, we have started URL encoding all URL paths and query string parameters.

Note: Remove manual encoding 🔪

If you fixed this issue manually by encoding the parameters, then with the new version, you must remove your explicit encoding; otherwise, the parameters will be double-encoded.

A new _Package Updates Available_ modal now greets you when outdated packages are detected in your workspace. You don't necessarily have to apply updates immediately, but when you do, click View Changelog to review each package you plan to update.

Changelog example:

## 30 January 2024

### New Feature

Now you can [replay script invocations](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/observability/script-invocation-logs/replay-script-invocations)!

### Update

New topic: [Sign JWT Token with a Private Key](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/scripting/code-snippets/sign-jwt-token-with-a-private-key)

## 12 January 2024

### New Feature

ScriptRunner Connect now supports [mutual TLS](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/) with [Fetch API](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/scripting/fetch-api). Take a look at [our example](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/scripting/code-snippets/perform-mutual-tls).

## 22 December 2023

### Updates

-   We overhauled our environments and deployments feature to simplify it but still retain the flexibility offered with the previous version. New [docs](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/workspaces/deployments-and-environments) have been published on how the new version works. For those who previously had a version deployed to their only environment, you will find that you can no longer make changes in that environment since now changes can only be made in an environment targeting a `HEAD` version. To overcome this situation, you can either create a new environment and keep it targeting the `HEAD` version and apply changes there and eventually promote those changes to your current environment, or re-target your current environment to target the `HEAD` version, which you can do if you click on the ellipsis icon and select `Deployment Manager`.
-   Avatar colors are now randomized.

## 29 November 2023

### New Feature

We created a [new template for Zendesk](https://app.scriptrunnerconnect.com/template/01HG8FA1N66Q0EJZM4AANB4P04)!

The template helps implement OAuth 2.0 for the app using our [generic connector](../c/connectors.md).

## 27 November 2023

### New Feature

You now have the ability to duplicate a workspace! 💾⚡💾

Gone are the days when you had to labor to duplicate a workspace by manually adding each script, API connection, and/or event listener from scratch. Total headache!

Now you can simply click the Options menu (ellipsis) on a workspace card, then select Duplicate.

Before the new workspace is created, you can change the title and description and even attribute the new workspace to a different team. Nice!

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed a bug that caused the user-specified `Content-Type` header value to be overwritten when using the generic connector.
-   Fixed a bug that caused selected items in the Workspace resource tree not to be highlighted.
-   Fixed vendor API URL links for the Jira Cloud Managed API.

## 09 November 2023

### Updates

-   Added a check to prevent the creation of a generic connector without a protocol being specified with the base URL.
-   Converted Trello templates to make use of Managed APIs for Trello-specific API calls.

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed a bug related to estimated dates for scheduled triggers that caused some estimated dates to be from the past.

## 03 November 2023

### New Feature

We created a [new template for Excel](https://app.scriptrunnerconnect.com/template/01HE30HQR4BXER40X6C2DXYM3T)!

The template demonstrates how to construct an Excel file in memory using a [third-party NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/write-excel-file) (thanks to our [package manager](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/demos#package-manager--en) feature) and then upload the file to Jira Cloud as an issue attachment.

## 21 September 2023
