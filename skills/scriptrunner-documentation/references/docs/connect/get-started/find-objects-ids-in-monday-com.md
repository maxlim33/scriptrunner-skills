Use this page to learn how to obtain the IDs for [Monday.com](http://monday.com/) objects, like boards, items, and columns.

When you have the IDs of your desired objects, you can use them in your scripts.

Note: Enter developer mode 💻

To find object IDs, you must [enable developer mode](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/getting-started-1#developer-mode). This enables viewing IDs in the UI and/or shows IDs in the browser URL.

Not sure how to find the ID of an object you need to use in a script? Check out [Managed API for monday.com](https://docs.adaptavist.com/src/latest/managed-apis/managed-api-for-monday.com).

## Account

To find the account ID, execute the following GraphQL in the API playground:

```
query {
    account {
        id
        name
    }
}
```

Note: Access the API playground by navigating toAccount > Developers > API Playground on [monday.com](http://monday.com/).

## Boards

To see the board ID, click on the board and check the browser URL. For example, the board URL should look like: `https://youraccount.monday.com/boards/123456789`. The `123456789` part is the ID.

## Board views

To find the board view URL, click on a board view and check the browser URL. The board view URL should look like: `https://youraccount.monday.com/boards/123456789/views/987654321`. The board view URL is the last sequence of numbers in the URL, `987654321`.

## Column

To find the column ID, hover over a column title and click the ellipses. A pop-up dialog displays the ID. Click on it to copy it to your clipboard.

## Document (Monday doc)

To get the document ID, click on a document to bring up the document pop-up. On the top left of the screen, you can see the document ID:

Note: As indicated in the image, the URL does not have the document ID.

Document block

You can find a document block's ID by using the following GQL query:

```
query {
    docs(ids: 123-YOUR-DOCUMENT-ID-7938) { //change this with your document ID
        blocks {
            id
            content
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you could run this script in ScriptRunner Connect and check the logs:

```
import Monday from "./api/monday";
 
export default async function(event: any, context: Context):
Promise<void> {
 
    const resp = await Monday.Doc.DocBlock.getDocBlocks({
        args: {
            ids: [23-YOUR-DOCUMENT-ID-7938]
        },
        fields: {
            blocks: {
                fields: {
                    id: true,
                    content: true
                }
            }
        }
    })
 
    resp.data.docs.forEach ( doc => {
        doc.blocks.forEach( block => {
            console.log(`Block with id : "${block.id}" and
content: ${block.content} `);
        })
    })
}
```

A third way to find the document block ID is as follows:

1.  Right-click on the document block, then click Copy Link.
2.  Paste the link into a text editor.
3.  Find the value that follows the `blockid`.
    
    The URL should look like `https://youraccount.monday.com/boards/123456789/pulses/123456789?doc_id=123456789&blockId=fbe7c7eb-e575-48aa-a52d-132aec26fdf4`. In this case, the document block ID is `fbe7c7eb-e575-48aa-a52d-132aec26fdf4`.
    

## File (asset)

To find a file ID, click on a file to open the asset screen. The URL should look like: `https://youraccount.monday.com/boards/1321359671/pulses/132135968C?asset_id=30284600`. The file ID is the sequence of numbers at the end of the URL, `30284600`.

## Folder

Click the ellipses next to the folder title to find the folder ID.

The ID will appear in the pop-up dialog box.

## Group

Currently, you cannot find a group ID by looking at the UI. You can find them with a GraphQL query in monday.com's API playground.

```
query {
    boards(ids: 123-BOARD_ID-789) { //make sure to replace this board ID with the board you are working with
        groups {
            id
            title
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you could run this script in ScriptRunner Connect and check the logs:

```
import Monday from "./api/monday";
 
export default async function(event: any, context: Context):
Promise<void> {
 
 const resp = await Monday.Board.Group.getGroups({
        args: {
            ids: [ 123-BOARD_ID-789 ]
        },
        fields: {
            groups: {
                fields: {
                    id: true,
                    title: true
                }
            }
        }
    })
    resp.data.boards.forEach ( board => {
        board.groups.forEach( group => {
            console.log(`Id for group ${group.title} is "$
{group.id}"`);
        })
    })
}
```

## Item/subitem

To find an item or subitem ID, click on it and check the browser URL. The URL should look like: `https://youraccount.monday.com/boards/123456789/pulses/987987987`. The item ID is the last number sequence in the URL, which in this case is `987987987`.

Alternatively, you can add the column type _Item ID_, which allows you to copy an item ID to your clipboard by clicking on a value in the column.

Here, you can see the ID on the board once you add the _Item ID_ column type:

## Item update

To find the ID of an item update, follow these steps:

1.  Click on an item and open the _Updates_ section.
2.  Click the ellipses, then click Copy Link to Update.
3.  Paste the link into a text editor.
    
    The URL that is pasted should look like `https://youraccount.monday.com/boards/123456789/pulses/654654654/posts/789789798`. The item update ID is the last number sequence in the URL, `789789798.`
    

## Team

You can find the team ID by running a GQL like this:

```
query {
    teams {
        id
        name
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you could run this script in ScriptRunner Connect and check the logs:

```
import Monday from "./api/monday";
 
export default async function(event: any, context: Context):
Promise<void> {
 
 const resp = await Monday.Team.getTeams({
        fields: {
            id: true,
            name: true
        }
    })
 
    resp.data.teams.forEach ( team => {
        console.log(`Team with id : ${team.id} and name: "$
{team.name}" `);
    })
}
```

## User

To find the user ID, open the user page for a user and look at the browser URL:

## Webhook

To find the webhook ID, find your webhook in the board automations. There, you'll find the webhook ID labelled as _Automation ID_.

## Workspace

To find the workspace ID, click on the workspace and check the browser URL.

The URL should look like: `https://youraccount.monday.com/workspaces/123456`. The workspace ID is the last number sequence in the URL, `123456`.
