HTTP logs allow you to peek under the hood to troubleshoot when you need to debug and investigate certain API call failures.

Whenever a script finishes executing, a corresponding log message appears in the console log with a link to download the logs for all HTTP calls made during the script invocation. Alternatively, you can also browse the HTTP logs from the [Script Invocation Logs](script-invocation-logs.md).

Note: Log retention 🪵

HTTP logs are kept for six months and then deleted from ScriptRunner Connect.

## HTTP log structure

```
{
    fetchId: number; // We count each HTTP call you're making, starting from 0 and increment each time.
    connectionId?: string; // API connection ID that was used, empty if raw Fetch API was used.
    originalDuration: number; // Time in milliseconds how long it took to get a response.
    duration: number; // Time in milliseconds how long it took to process the entire HTTP call (overhead).
    request: {
        url: string; // URL of the request, relative URL in case when Managed API or Managed Fetch call was used.
        method: string; // HTTP method.
        headers: Record<string, string>; // HTTP headers.
        responseBody: 'fetch' | 'skip'; // Flag that indicates whether the response body was asked to be fetched.
        time: string; // Timestamp when request was initiated in ISO time.
        body?: {
            size: number; // Size of the body in bytes.
            truncated: boolean; // Whether the body is truncated in the log, anything larger than 1KB gets truncated.
            text: string; // Body content in string format (might be truncated).
        }
    },
    response: {
        status: number; // Response status code.
        time: // Timestamp when response arrived in ISO time.
        headers: Record<string, string>; // Response headers.
        body: {
            size: number; // Size of the body in bytes.
            truncated: boolean; // Whether the body is truncated in the log, anything larger than 1KB gets truncated.
            text: string; // Body content in string format (might be truncated).
        }
    }
}
```

## Additional system headers

To make troubleshooting easier, ScriptRunner Connect adds the following additional system headers to the response:

-   x-stitch-fetch-id - Fetch ID, which is also exposed in the fetchId field at the top level.
-   x-stitch-fetch-time - Time, in milliseconds, it took to get a response; this info is also exposed in the duration field at the top level.
-   x-stitch-proxied-url - Final URL that the request was sent to, which only appears following successful API calls. If issues with the API connection exist, this header does not appear.
-   x-stitch-rate-limit - This header is set to `true` if your external API call was rate limited by ScriptRunner Connect rather than by the destination you were trying to call.
