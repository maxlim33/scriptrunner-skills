Follow these instructions to create a connection to Slack.

## Create Slack App

First, you will need to navigate to Slack API to create an app with a name and a Slack domain. Here we walk through creating a simple slack app which allows a bot to post a message to a user.

Tip: We suggest setting up your Slack app on a development workspace first.

1.  Navigate to Slack's [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1) page and click Create an App.
2.  Enter an App Name, for example, ScriptRunner Integration.
3.  Choose your Development Slack Workspace.
    
    You'll need to either sign in to your workspace or [create a new workspace](https://slack.com/create) to add it as your development workspace.
    
4.  Navigate to OAuth & Permissions and click Add an OAuth Scope under Bot Token Scopes.
    
    These [scopes](https://api.slack.com/scopes) tell your app the permissions that it has access to, such as sending messages or viewing rooms.
    
    For example, add the _im:write_ scope if you want your Slack bot to post a message to a user. You can edit this later to add extra permissions, such as _chat:write_ and _chat:write:public_ to post to a channel.
    
5.  Once you have added at least one scope, navigate to App Home.
6.  Click Edit to change the Display Name and Default username for your bot (the app uses the _bot user_ to post in the workspace).
    
    The Display Name is the name that will be displayed on Slack when a message is sent.
    
7.  Click Save.
8.  Navigate back to the OAuth and Permissions tab and click Install to Workspace to install the app.
    
9.  The Bot Oauth Access Token now displays at the top of the _OAuth & Permissions_ page.
    
    This is the token the feature needs to send messages, click the Copy button.
    

## Set up the Slack Resource

1.  Navigate to ScriptRunner > Resources > Add New Item > Slack Connection.
2.  Provide a name for the connection in Connection Name. For example, slack or if you use multiple workspaces use the workspace name.
3.  Enter the _Bot OAuth Token_ for your Slack workspace in Token.
    
    Tip: For help getting your _Bot OAuth Token_ see _Create a Slack App_ above.
    
    Note: The token provided can be viewed by administrators.
    
4.  Click Preview to validate the connection using the token provided.
5.  Click Add.
    
    Your Slack connection is now configured.
    
6.  To test the connection, navigate to ScriptRunner > Script Console.
7.  Use the simple script below to test that the bot can post to a user and/or a channel.
    
    Note: We recommend you test your slack connection using your own user details, or set up a test slack room.
    
    When sending a message to a Slack channel the scope _chat:write_ is required…​ for a public channel _chat:write\_public_ is required. To send a direct message the scope _users:read.email_ is required.
    
    ```
    import com.onresolve.scriptrunner.slack.SlackUtil
    
    SlackUtil.message(
        "slack",                         // Identifier you provided when creating the resource
        "acme-developers",               // channel name or ID, or user email
        "Hi, this is the message text"   // Message text
    )
    ```
    
    Tip: Accepted values for the _channel_ argument (the second argument) are public or private channel name (or ID), or a user's email address, or ID, to send a direct message.
    
    The full list of allowed parameters that can be used to format your Slack messages can be found [here](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) .
    
    Note: Remember that a Slack bot requires certain [scopes](https://api.slack.com/scopes) to message a user and/or channel. If these test scripts fail, check the Bot Token Scopes under OAuth & Permissions for your [Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps) .
    
    -   _chat:write_: send messages to channels
    -   _chat:write.public_: send messages to channels the _bot user_ user isn't a member of.
    -   _files:write_: upload files
    -   _users:read_ and _users:read.email_: send direct messages to a user
    -   _chat:write.customize_: send messages as _bot user_ with a customized username and avatar
    

## Slack Examples

Having set up your Slack connection, you can now use it in your ScriptRunner scripts using the resource Connection Name.

### Using Blocks and Attachments

The following example sends a message using [blocks](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit) and [attachments](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage). In this case the message text provided is used as a fallback option.

```
import com.onresolve.scriptrunner.slack.SlackUtil

SlackUtil.message("slack",
    "acme-developers",
    "This is the fallback message text",
    [
        username   : "ScriptRunner Bot",
        blocks     : [
            [
                type: 'section',
                text: [
                    type: 'plain_text',
                    text: 'Message text'
                ]
            ]
        ],
        attachments: [
            [
                pretext: 'Introductory text',
                text   : 'Text message as part of attachment'
            ],
        ]
    ]
)
```

Tip: Use the [block kit builder](https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder) to preview your messages.

### Uploading a File

Upload file to a Slack channel. Scope _files:write_ is required. You can either upload a file to a channel (if the bot user is part of this channel) or to a specific user:

```
import com.onresolve.scriptrunner.slack.SlackUtil

SlackUtil.upload("slack",
    "acme-developers",
    new File("/tmp/file.txt"),
    [
        text           : 'Fallback text',
        initial_comment: 'Comment about the file being uploaded',
    ]
)
```

Note: To send an attachment the app must be added to the channel, which you can do by clicking the _Add apps_ link from the channel details, then the More menu.

Tip: The full list of allowed parameters can be found [here](https://api.slack.com/methods/files.upload).
