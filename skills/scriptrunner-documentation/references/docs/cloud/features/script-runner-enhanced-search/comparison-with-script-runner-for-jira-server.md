Note: Migrating to Cloud?

For more details, or if you are migrating to Cloud, refer to the [Platform Differences between ScriptRunner for Jira Server/DC and Jira Cloud](../../script-runner-migration-to-cloud/platform-differences-between-script-runner-for-jira-server-dc-and-jira-cloud.md) and [Feature Parity and Script Alternatives](../../script-runner-migration-to-cloud/feature-parity-and-script-alternatives.md) sections within our [ScriptRunner Migration to Cloud](../../uncategorized/s/script-runner-migration-to-cloud.md) section. For JQL functions and Keywords to work, you must complete an [initial synchronisation](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4jc/latest/features/scriptrunner-enhanced-search/scriptrunner-enhanced-search-jql-keywords-synchronization#scriptrunner-enhanced-search-jql-keywords-synchronization-perform-an-initial-synchronisation--en) after migrating.

Although you may be familiar with advanced queries in the [Jira Server](../../../data-center/uncategorized/g/get-started.md) version of ScriptRunner, the Cloud infrastructure differs and, therefore, some queries are not available or are implemented differently. Even if you have a good understanding of [JQL Functions from Jira Server](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/jql-functions), it's worth noting that some of the concepts here are a little different.

As it is not possible to integrate directly into the standard search functionality that Jira Cloud provides, the [ScriptRunner Enhanced Search](https://docs.adaptavist.com/db/organizations/adaptavist/repositories/master/content/documents/Adaptavist_Content/ScriptRunner/ScriptRunner_for_Jira_Cloud_SR4JC/topics/scriptrunner_enhanced_search.dita) functionality provides the ability to run advanced JQL functions in your Jira filters in a similar way to ScriptRunner for Jira Server. You can read more details on the differences in the [JQL Query Comparison](https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4jc/latest/features/scriptrunner-enhanced-search#comparison-with-scriptrunner-for-jira-server--en__jql-query-comparison) information.

Note: It is not possible in Jira Cloud for an add-on to alter the results of a JQL search either during or after a search is being performed.

## Differences

-   If you want to use a custom field, you can use either field key `customfield_10500` or field name e.g. `'StoryPoints'`. Custom field names are likely to have spaces, which can't be parsed. If so, remove the spaces. It's not case-sensitive but use camel-case for maximum readability. If your field names have any other punctuation you must use the format `customfield_10500`.
-   When you specify regular expressions, you don't have to escape backslash characters. Example: write `\d+` instead of `\\\d+`

## Unsupported functions

Compared to ScriptRunner for Jira Server, we cannot deliver the functions described below.

`myProjects/recentProjects`

We are not able to support queries that are based on user-specific data.

`aggregateExpression`

At this time we are not implementing this function.

## JQL query comparison

The table below contains equivalent JQL queries from ScriptRunner for Jira Server and Jira Cloud. Differences between the two systems are highlighted.
