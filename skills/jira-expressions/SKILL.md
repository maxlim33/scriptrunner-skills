# Jira Expressions Skill

Use this skill whenever you need to write, review, or convert a Jira
expression. On ScriptRunner for Jira Cloud, workflow conditions and validators
must be implemented as Jira expressions (post functions remain Groovy-based).

## Activation Signals

- The task involves a Jira Cloud workflow condition or validator.
- The user asks for a Jira expression, or to convert Data Center Groovy
  workflow logic to Cloud.
- You are reviewing or debugging an expression that fails to evaluate.

## Workflow

1. If a `jira-expression-generator` subagent is available in your
   environment, delegate expression generation to it instead of using this
   skill's references directly - it embeds the same reference material.
2. Otherwise, read `references/reference.md` in full before writing any
   expression. Jira Expressions is **not** JavaScript: only the syntax,
   methods, and properties documented there exist, and anything else fails at
   runtime.
3. Read `references/examples.md` for worked condition and validator
   patterns before inventing your own.
4. Validate the result against the reference: a workflow condition or
   validator must evaluate to a boolean, and expensive-operation limits apply.

## Notes

- Output raw expression text only - no markdown fences and no language hint
  lines such as `jira-expression`.
- Apply null checks liberally (`?.`, `?? `, explicit `!= null`); hidden
  fields and missing custom fields return `null`.
- When converting from Data Center Groovy, preserve Groovy truthiness, null
  ordering, and string literals exactly as the reference's translation rules
  describe.
- If the request cannot be achieved with the Jira Expressions DSL, say so and
  explain the limitation instead of inventing undocumented syntax.
