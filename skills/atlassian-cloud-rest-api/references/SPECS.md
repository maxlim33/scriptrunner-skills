## Lookup pattern

1. Use `rg` to find candidate paths, operationIds, or component names.
2. Use `jq` to inspect the specific path/method or component.
3. Resolve any `$ref` chains before generating code.
4. Cite the spec file plus resolved operation and schema names.

## Ref checklist

- Resolve path-level `parameters`
- Resolve operation-level `parameters`
- Resolve `requestBody`
- Resolve `responses`
- Resolve nested schema `$ref` values
- Inspect `allOf`, `oneOf`, `anyOf`, and array `items`
